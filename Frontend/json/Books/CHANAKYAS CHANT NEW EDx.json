{"pace":{"posr1":"the portion of the chanakya is fantastic and really very good. The author has worked very hard in research of the history and the efforts are quire appreciable. Only the current era portion was somewhat boring due to the political quotas of gangasagar mishra but in spite of that the pace was really good.. A good to read and nice couple of one liners at the very end of the novel......","negr1":"now thats a real deal when it comes to story reading ........beautifully paced really we indians once were actual rulers of world waning from that height really requires ignorance and laziness which is very much true...till date there's no better politician and shrewd individual like Chanakya........loved every bit of its plotting and furious pace...completed in 1 sitting in a day....definite page turner","posr2":"excellent pace of the book.shrewd intelligent adaptation of chanakya into modern world indian politics.gives an insight in to many scandals and there perspective.must read for shrewd insight in to the dirty bad word called politics","negative":1,"positive":2},"reading":{"posr1":"The book is quite interesting till around half mark. The concept o f narrating the ancient and contemporary simultaneously is fine. But later on, the ancient part is digestive being history, however, the present appears to be incomprehensible and filmy and resembles a bollywood script. The language is good with stingy sprinkling of humour. Be that as it may, the book is very good for brisk reading and enjoyable.","positive":1},"thrillerand":{"posr1":"Chanakya's Chant is a very exciting book.It relates the modern day and modern politics with ancient times,2300 years ago that one can see the picture in front of the eyes.The plot moves in a swift pace but it manages to give the reader each and every detail of the locations.It is one of the best political thrillerand its adventurous plot inspires me read it 100 times.","positive":1},"politics":{"negr1":"The narration is good from starting till ending. Connecting Chanakya's story with modern politics is very nice. Somethings we can predicted whats going to happen as we would have seen this kind of things many places.. overall its a nice read","negr2":"Nice way to depict Chankya's life in parallel with present day politics. Arthashastra depends on Rajneeti, both can't be segregated.","negative":7},"description":{"posr1":"This book contains a historically accurate and interesting description of Chanakya's life and works. This book is suitable for people of all ages because of its versatility. A must-buy for any history enthusiast.","positive":1},"blend":{"posr1":"A good blend of ancient times with the modern age. Absolutely fast paced and thrilling. The uncanny portrayal of Gangasagar as the modern Chanakya is simply brilliant. Ashwin's capability of penning down espionage , murder, political sabotages and propaganda is simply awesome. A must read for all. Its like a modern day Mahabharata in a nutshell.","posr2":"Its rare that you come across books that you want to revisit, even before you have completed once. And even rarer, that you actually end up reading it twice. Chanakya's Chant is one such rare exponent of perfection in writing. An amazing blend of two voraciously written plots, it flawlessly integrates the diametrically opposite ages into a theme. Blockbuster read. Must be in every bookshelf.","positive":2},"gripping":{"negr1":"The book is divided between the past and the present times. Though it revolves around on Chankya's deeds, its adaption in the modern world is more engrossing. This is probably because the built up of the story is more eventual and well done for the modern times. But overall quiet gripping and a good read!","negative":1},"confusion":{"posr1":"Dodging two different areas this book places too many characters at one place. Untill you go full concentration, easy confusion is on the cards. Politics is rampant in the narrative which can confuse and even bore the casual reader. choose it wisely as its much heavy interpreting this one.","positive":1},"intellect":{"negr1":"A mind bobbling and fascinating story where the author takes you 2300 years,back in history, also drawing a parallel with the modern day. Chanakya known as one of the most intelligent person has been reincarnated in the modern day and acted in the same manner as Chanakya displaying his unexceptional intellect in the true sense of the term. After The Rosabal Line,its worth reading.","negative":1},"picture":{"posr1":"Good thriller Good mixing of past & present Gives a good picture of our nation's DIRTY POLITICS., and what controls everything in our system","positive":1},"narration":{"negr1":"becomes very predictable for those who know the history well enough. and amateurish writing, and boring narration, read it for the sake of reading it, could not keep me hooked up even for 10 pages or so","negr2":"the plot/storyline is good, but the narration is bad. the author has tried to put the characters in excruciating detail, which is totally unnecessary and boring. I wasted my time reading this book.","negative":2},"word":{"negr1":"excellent pace of the book.shrewd intelligent adaptation of chanakya into modern world indian politics.gives an insight in to many scandals and there perspective.must read for shrewd insight in to the dirty bad word called politics","negative":1},"characters":{"posr1":"Brilliant book on Indian Mythology.....The author, Ashwin Sanghi shares an interesting imaginative comparison between the two main characters in the story, Chanakya and Pandit Gangasagar Mishra. This political thriller is a must read for everyone.","positive":1},"knowledge":{"posr1":"Heady cocktail of Power, Politics, and History. A compulsive page turner. Brilliant narration and its interweaved with historical anecdotes. Fresh characters, gripping sub-plots, and wide knowledge on the topics. Go for it -- STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.","negr1":"When u read about our history than you have lot of other extra knowledge which we don't want to read this is the book where you can read all the important events and step what chanakya take at there life. with very interesting current world chanakya's story. a full of suspense and with lot of mind food. a roller coaster story,.. must read","negative":1,"positive":1},"Politics":{"negr1":"Dirty Politics, how bad politics can be played by any person.... !!! Ultimate Story.... I brought this book only by its title... but found it really interesting.... Kept my interest bound till the very last page and completed it late night... one of the very fast read by me after long....","negative":1},"scenarios":{"posr1":"The way the author has woven the past and the present scenarios in a dramatic manner is amazing. Enjoyed my read..Thanks!","positive":1},"character":{"posr1":"totally glued to it, awesome book. A must buy for thriller loving. The story starts with the sworning in of 18th PM of India and rolls back to the past and back to the present. The best character and the protagonist Gangasagar Mishra is alike Chankya.","negr1":"I don't know why this book is so famous.. it's one of the most boring book i have ever read. Except Chanakya no other character is engaging. Its like one of the bollywood movies where only one character does everything.","posr2":"A real page turner which gives insights of the Indian politics. It can easily be related to the current politics by one and all..nicely built upon the strong character and intellect of Chanakya. The transformation of present situation and the moves made by Chanakya has been extraordinary. It has all the qualities of turning out to be a feature film and I am not surprised that UTV motion pictures has bought the rights.","negative":1,"positive":2},"style":{"posr1":"This book will really keep you glued to it till the last page.Ashwin Sanghi's style of writing is awesome and he has well-knitted both modern plot and ancient plot. I would strongly recommend this book!!! Thanks to flipkart once again for the timely delivery.","positive":1},"words":{"negr1":"I enjoyed reading book. plots were very good. Didn't enjoyed any book as this. But i think that abusive words are used much. But all over book was really good. Will be reading The Rozabal Line now.","negative":1},"read":{"posr1":"Good read in terms of knowing the style of a comparatively new writer.. Chanakya's part is more of smooth literature artwork full with manipulations, where Panditji's part is more like showcasing fictional naked and vulnerable side of modern politics.. Overall, a good read !!","posr2":"Such a powerful read. This is my first book from Ashwin Sanghi's collection and it has been an amazing read. The storytelling gripped me throughout the time. I've delayed few other works to take out time for me to finish it and I don't regret it. Chanakya's Chant sail between two different eras bringing you the dirtiest, informative and amusing story.","positive":5},"fiction":{"posr1":"it's a vary good fiction seen for a long time. But you cannot take it as refrence to history. I want to say to mr sanghavi you should not manipulate history to bring masala in your creation. Its not so good. But as a fiction its brilliant piece of copying caractors and story. Good work mr. Ashwin.","positive":1},"portion":{"posr1":"the portion of the chanakya is fantastic and really very good. The author has worked very hard in research of the history and the efforts are quire appreciable. Only the current era portion was somewhat boring due to the political quotas of gangasagar mishra but in spite of that the pace was really good.. A good to read and nice couple of one liners at the very end of the novel......","positive":1},"interpreting":{"posr1":"Dodging two different areas this book places too many characters at one place. Untill you go full concentration, easy confusion is on the cards. Politics is rampant in the narrative which can confuse and even bore the casual reader. choose it wisely as its much heavy interpreting this one.","positive":1},"re-enactment":{"negr1":"This book is a perfect book describing the modern day re-enactment of chanakya by a teacher. This book is one of my favourites and i recommend it to every person and everyone. This book also describes the great ability of Ashwin Sanghi as an author GO FOR IT","negative":1},"material":{"posr1":"Ordered this book after reading many reviews. I must say this book is written quite well. It does not add anything to the history or explore new avenues but gives the reader ample material to know about Chanakya. Ashwin Sanghi's writing style is lucid. He concentrates on the subject material than explaining the landscape and other details. He lets the reader to imagine the setting. Timepass stuff","positive":1},"adaptation":{"posr1":"excellent pace of the book.shrewd intelligent adaptation of chanakya into modern world indian politics.gives an insight in to many scandals and there perspective.must read for shrewd insight in to the dirty bad word called politics","positive":1},"ending":{"posr1":"First i read The Krishna Key and then Chanakya's Chant and both the books had 2 things in common . The books were difficult to put down and keeps you engaged . However when it came to end they both could have had a better ending . Lets hope that The Rozabal Line have a good story and a good ending .","posr2":"The narration is good from starting till ending. Connecting Chanakya's story with modern politics is very nice. Somethings we can predicted whats going to happen as we would have seen this kind of things many places.. overall its a nice read","positive":2},"history":{"negr1":"this would give bollywood masala movies a run for its money. straight out of the script of a bollywood formula movie incuding the item numbers. just riding on the wave of history/mythology based books by others but a complete disaapointment. and for people who read real history this is just junk. Please, threw this in the dustbin. complete waste of money.","negr2":"If you want to look politics from a different point of view, history from the skies or understand today's politics or business deals, go ahead with this book. when i started this book i thought it to be a mere history reciting book, but was completely amazed by the plot and strategy.","negative":2},"paced":{"posr1":"A good blend of ancient times with the modern age. Absolutely fast paced and thrilling. The uncanny portrayal of Gangasagar as the modern Chanakya is simply brilliant.
