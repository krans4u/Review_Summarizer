{"fight":{"posr1":"An interesting, easy and captivating read that will keep you glued. Characters are very real and you can easily connect with them.

The writer gives good picture about the culture and daily life of the people in the two states. The characterization is also good with a varied range of characters.","negr1":"2 states is like a poor old screenplay of a 10 yr old bollywood movie. Mr.Bhagat doesn't seem to express any thoughts.. all he wanted to do is giving something to a specified group of readers, to impress them. The jokes are too old and characterization is so poor. This one is not even worth for 90 RS. Try to get any dickens Classics @ this price..","posr2":"A story which, besides having its own ups and lows, takes the reader as well into the roller coaster of drama, drama and drama which ultimately gets a little too monotonous. Although the plot goes like a bollywood flick, the book is written in a really captivating style. Great characterization and use of language. Chetan Bhagat does a good job altogether.","negative":1,"positive":2},"package":{"posr1":"So another great story by chetan bhaghat......another boy stressed in life bw his family love career and all....in short a great package for entertainment......i am reading it...its half completed....and till now its amazing.....BUY IT....................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)","negr1":"Writing a long tiring review isn't necessary.
