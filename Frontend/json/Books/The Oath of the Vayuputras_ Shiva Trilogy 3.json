{"writings":{"negr1":"The end to a extremely well written saga was satisfyingly good. Amish has shown great promise and as a avid fan of mythology, would love to see his next writings. Though entertaining the end could have been a bit more elaborate. All in all a worthwhile read.","negative":1},"fight":{"negr1":"Amish has a vivid imagination. Clubbed with our Hindu mythology, he has created a great novel which adds a different dimension to our past memories. The age old argument between Good and Evil was addressed very well and finished with a heart- wrenching account of the last fight. You finish the book with sadness in your heart, which was a bit unexpected. Overall a good read.","negative":1},"intelligence":{"posr1":"Amish has taken us on a beautiful visual journey with the Siva Trilogy and the third and last book of the series was brilliantly cenceptualized and powerfully written. The author's protrayal of our loved Gods Ganesh, Karthik, Siva and Sati is simply awesome. Love the depth of each and every character, loved the intelligence behind every war strategy and loved the fact that the words weaved amazing visuals of ancient India.","posr2":"Living with the strength of the plot, the emotional intelligence added to the subject with a great interpretation of the present generation has given this book a great sense of reality and uniqueness exploring the ancient cultural heritage of India . Har Har Mahadev.","positive":2},"magic":{"posr1":"The sheer magic of suspense, the intricate twisting of mythology into subplots which defined the awesomeness of Immortals of Meluha and Secret of Nagas is completely missing here. The Oath of Vayuputras was too predictable. Sure the trailing off and potential leads to another trilogy based on Mahabharata is intriguing but the book per se has failed to reach up to the expectations.","positive":1},"quality":{"posr1":"I love the packing and book received on time with good quality. Just regret that I can get the same order in few more less amount if I would have wait more :) Still I'm happy happy.","posr2":"Recd d book,..however the page quality is not good,..seems like a fake copy,..could have bought a fake one by paying much less amount,....","positive":4},"trilogy":{"posr1":"1st two parts were good... but this book..the climax sucked... not what lord shiva would have done...stupid thinking i really liked the concept of the movie but the big let down by the author in the finale not a great ending but a good trilogy....","posr2":"O Lord Amish..why! a big loss.. it could have been the greatest trilogy in the literary world.. Alas! I am your big fan..i started worshiping Lord Shiva after I read the first two... ohhhhhhhhh. too much pain for a book lover..if the last one of the trilogy doesn't go down well. anyways, thanks...nevertheless you are a great writer","positive":12},"plot":{"posr1":"Fastest delivery by flipkart.. received on 27 th feb .. around 4 pm While the plot seems interesting in beginning, it becomes less interesting in the ending.. The story is very descriptive and i have to say that Amish has done a lot of research and written this masterpiece.. Though longer than the previous two, the book is well written considering the different views of characters and superb plot.","negr1":"Of the shiva's trilogy the first two installments were interesting and intriguing. The initial flow of the third installment is equally engrossing but it lets you down in the middle and tail of the final plot as it is made unnecesasarily dramatic and emotional. The author has tried to justify/ reason the present belief about the characters through some imaginary fictional acts which is completely unwarrranted.","posr2":"Kudos to the Flipkart for delivering the book on the Releasing Date itself..As expected the book turned out to be as awesome as its predecessors. The narration & the plot were equally awesome. The book kept me glued till the end and i didn't even felt the urge to eat or drink till the end....Excellent work by Amish Tripathi!!!!!!!","negr2":"No so good and exciting as the other two books. Quite sluggish at my place......... Not a good page turner ,lost plot at many places.... Some conversations do not relate to plot, but for the sake of completing the series can be read.","negative":2,"positive":5},"adventure":{"posr1":"This is a grand finale. But try To Purchase it in hindi to feel the feelings of writer. suspense of this book never ends anywhere. at Each and every position thinking of writer is more ahead than that of the reader. Parsuram Appearance in this book create a wonderful adventure in this book.","posr2":"Amish has yet again carried his invention artistically. His aesthetic senses are at its zenith tinged with creativity. Unlike TIOM or TSOTN this one is very fast moving. A new adventure and logic surfaces on each page. The deepest remorse and the toughest decisions of human life has been woven into a fine fabric.","positive":2},"life":{"posr1":"This last book of the famous mythological trilogy has lived to its expectation. Its a page turner altogether which just binds you to its story line from the first line. The author's imagination to collaborate the mythological stories , concepts with the protagonist - Shiva's life is highly appreciated. Amish lived beyond my expectation. It should be converted into a feature film. Bravo Amish!","negr1":"A very great work by Amish .Clearly defining why we worship Shiva. Intermingling with emotions of different persons and a terrific end to the story has made it a top choice for readers. A unexpected turn around of events meant that Shiva had to return to Melhua to finishhis undone job. But then life would not be same for Shiva.","posr2":"it was an immense pleasure to go through the last part of shiva triology ........wonderful!!!!!!!! i have bought all the version from flipcart and i really look forward in the future too for ordering books and other stuufs via flipcart it really makes life easy...","negative":1,"positive":3},"surprises":{"posr1":"A very well written fiction. A fitting end to the stories created in the first two books. It also give a peek into what the author has in his mind for future. Only a very few surprises in the plot at this stage. But follows a typical trilogy pattern where the final book is more about tying the story together rather than creating new turns and twists. Liked it a lot.","positive":1},"Trilogy":{"posr1":"Amish is a fabulous story teller. Just loved the entire Shiva Trilogy especially this book. Although some part of this books seems quite slow and more descriptive than usual eventful-flow. But overall this is simply a great book full of mystery, adventure and thrill.....must read :)","positive":1},"description":{"posr1":"immortals of meluha and secret of nagas had many good twists and turns ......where as vayuputras seemed little boring. Yet !!!!!! the entire boredom flies away in the end. The description was sooooooooo awesome and I must say I cried a lot. :P Worth reading. A very good approach by Amish :)","posr2":"After Secret of Nagas I was expecting shiva to fulfill his legacy or something but instead, I get a full scale in-depth description of strategic battles throughout the book. Vayuputra tribe is severely underrepresented and book is a major let down. Read this book just to finish this trilogy..","positive":2},"mythology":{"posr1":"excellent book. as much as i liked reading it , so much i liked holding this book in my hands. superb quality paper and cover with outstanding binding. a must read for all interested in indian mythology and lord shiva. but to understand the book you must go through the first 2 parts of the triology. immortals of meluha and seccret of nagas","negr1":"The way the story unfolds with twists and the way he connected it with the existing mythology was simply OUT OF THE WORLD!... There is the philosophy involved in every nook and corner of a story justifying both good and bad !....","negative":1,"positive":1},"perspective":{"posr1":"good read... a fitting end to the trilogy............. nice perspective on history..... Mr. Amish is a great writer and I hope to read many more from him...","posr2":"Good read. All the characters have been bound together beautifully. Gives the readers a different perspective on the characters.","positive":2},"explanation":{"posr1":"A very nice end to the trilogy... though was a little boring towards the beginning, Amish has done a great job. Though some times you may feel that in the process of tying all the lose ends, he has gone into a detailed explanation which slows down the story.","posr2":"Its a mythological tale having all the Gods as Humans. 3rd part starts with an interesting turn of events. Honestly true evil was not easy to predict. Though it gets a little boring in the middle due to extensive explanation of the surrounding but still it doesn't let the reader loose interest. Last chapter is a must read. How normal persons were converted into God.","positive":2},"narration":{"posr1":"Kudos to the Flipkart for delivering the book on the Releasing Date itself..As expected the book turned out to be as awesome as its predecessors. The narration & the plot were equally awesome. The book kept me glued till the end and i didn't even felt the urge to eat or drink till the end....Excellent work by Amish Tripathi!!!!!!!","posr2":"The narration is good. It holds you to the book. It is quite a lengthy book, but it is worth completing.","positive":4},"secrets":{"posr1":"With this book many new secrets are exposed and shiva's character comes out in full , it's great with more emphasis is given to action part of it with more light is shed on other characters also the end could have been greater , is little less twisted but again if i think from author's point of view , it's probably the best end that could have been possible for this great saga of shiva","positive":1},"battles":{"posr1":"After Secret of Nagas I was expecting shiva to fulfill his legacy or something but instead, I get a full scale in-depth description of strategic battles throughout the book. Vayuputra tribe is severely underrepresented and book is a major let down. Read this book just to finish this trilogy..","negr1":"the book is the third installment in the shiva trilogy series and hence holds a specific grip to the series, the book as its other parts is extraordinary and the narration of the incidents are yet lively...the book gets you on a ride of emotions, fierce battles, betrayal and love with lots of secrets to be revealed advised to read in continuation with previous parts to enjoy the emotional connection","negative":1,"positive":1},"style":{"posr1":"Engaging illustration, gripping narration style, is unique, which hold you on to the story. Recommended reading, since its an action filled comic, anyone of any age can pick it up.","negr1":"History served in modern style..!! Will keep u fascinated..!!! Amish has described everything with logic which we all thinks magical.","posr2":"best books i have ever read.best of the triolgy...curiosity jumps every page.the story gets interesting every chapter. interesting narrating style..one can feel the story . must accept amish tripati the best author of india.","negative":1,"positive":4},"climax":{"posr1":"I have been a great fan of the Meluha series but saying truely the climax was not as expected........comparing it from Meluha & Nagas this novel donot have the good or better to say amazing or suprising climax...leaving the climax part it was awsum & nycly written strongly recomended not for starters.....","negr1":"I have admired Amish's approach of the story. The way he blends mythology and fiction deserves a standing ovation. Though the second book wasn't as impressive as the first one, the third installment has compensated for that! The unexpected climax and the messages he convey through the story are something that will make this book worth remembering. I hope he writes more on mythology. Har Har Mahadev!!","posr2":"Lengthier than other books of trilogy, but deserves that. A very good climax. I bet you will feel a sense of fulfillment after reading the book and it will haunt you for rest of your life. Though there are some additional details given but you can enjoy reading on the surface. I read it some 4-5 months ago but still remembering it makes me feel enthusiastic. enjoy reading it.","negr2":"A good start in this 3rd part with lots of aggression expected but An unexpected climax with lots of small wars in between...if you love mythology and wars ...shiva trilogy will be the one ...overall a good sequel by amish..Now i became a die hard fan of SHIVA....","negative":2,"positive":3},"message":{"posr1":"A very enjoyable read. Amish has, in very simple language, brought forth the true message of the Vedas and the Mahabharat - honor, dignity, truth, loyalty, service to mankind and love of God. Jai Jai Sri Ram","positive":1},"drama":{"posr1":"Was really expecting more from Amish this time. They got us hooked with two great books and ended it with an average book with the same \"India had nuclear weapons drama\". I mean seriously, can we please not beat the same drum (Cough-- The Krishna key--). I mean we all saw the Ancient Aliens series on The History Channel.","positive":1},"heritage":{"negr1":"Living with the strength of the plot, the emotional intelligence added to the subject with a great interpretation of the present generation has given this book a great sense of reality and uniqueness exploring the ancient cultural heritage of India . Har Har Mahadev.","negative":1},"Diverted":{"negr1":"Just a wonderful read. Diverted too much from Indian history but still managed to mark the point. The cover was nice so as the the characters in the book. Best u can expect from an Indian author.","negative":1},"combination":{"posr1":"The trilogy ended in the perfect combination of war, EVIL, revenge, death, love.. Made me an ardent of Shiva even more. Found it slow at times, but caught up pace at the right time! Hats off to Amish! Worth a read to the suspense filled trilogy.","positive":1},"language":{"negr1":"A very enjoyable read. Amish has, in very simple language, brought forth the true message of the Vedas and the Mahabharat - honor, dignity, truth, loyalty, service to mankind and love of God. Jai Jai Sri Ram","negative":1},"character":{"posr1":"I think its the worst of the three. There are few live action sequences and hopelessly long arguments and brainstorming sessions. Sati is the only credible character in the entire book. The ending seems like somebody is trying to finish his/her exam papers after the final bell. Not impressed at all.","positive":1},"epic":{"negr1":"An epic conclusion to this \"modern epic\"... That's what it is. Wonderfully scripted, keeps you hooked till the end... & a story that almost all of us are so acquainted with is reinvented at the end... Love, Deception, Friendship, Loyalty, Pride, Bravery, Treachery, Respect, Honor, it's got almost every flavor one can think of............. A masterpiece by Amish","negative":1},"fiction":{"posr1":"Its really a good fiction which nearly coinsides with the mythelogical story, u can learn some science, philosophy and love.","posr2":"The book is much different from its predecessors in terms of action.Its fast-paced,thrilling and satisfying piece of literature.The author has tastefully depicted war scenes starting with the opening moves till the end.It is a fitting end to the popular historical fiction,which is constructed entirely on logic and reasoning. So i recommend this book to all book lovers coz its a priceless treat that you cant miss.","positive":3},"masterpiece":{"posr1":"A breezy read.... don't expect a literary masterpiece... the book is a bit long considering the first 2 books, but the author stays true to his style of delving into myths for the sake of the story and combining it with dodgy historical facts... which makes it enjoyable for conspiracy theorists :-) recommended to read the first 2 books to understand the storyline...","positive":1},"explanations":{"posr1":"clarification...flipkart was wonderful... its the novel thats disappointing.At times there is so much explanation that u feel u r sitting in a nursery class and the author loses track of the story line. Dear amish please trust the iq level of your readers to understand some basic things without your detailed explanations. the end is also alet down.","posr2":"Already read with previous 2 books i was excited to read this. Amish, one of the finest writer, who have potraited things in very simple, logical and understandable manner. All his explanations are great. I love this triology.","positive":3},"pace":{"posr1":"The book is based on a theme that ' in revenge everybody losses'. The author has splendidly lifted the veil, revealing the mystery at a right pace. But the end as it should be is the most interesting part as what one expect to happen doesn't happen, concluding one of the most amazing and thrilling series of books.","positive":1},"narrative":{"posr1":"The book has many twists and has a very impressive narrative style.Damn good.","posr2":"First & foremost - it could have been easily edited down to 100-150 pages less. A great narrative & clever navouring of story was killed by over clarification & attempt to over simplify. In a good book, author weaves the story, set the stage & leave it to reader's imagination also. Amish seemed cautious to make everything so clarified that I ended up feeling like reading a 6th class text book.","positive":2},"illustration":{"posr1":"Engaging illustration, gripping narration style, is unique, which hold you on to the story. Recommended reading, since its an action filled comic, anyone of any age can pick it up.","positive":1},"action":{"posr1":"The most perfect ending to a mind blowing trilogy. Every detail is covered, no place is left for doubts or confusion. The action is vivid and the emotions are heart wrenching. Amish Tripathy has done a fabulous job without any doubt.","negr1":"The last in the series of Shiva Trilogy 3, Vayuputras series the action is slow paced not as better as the first two !","negative":1,"positive":1},"presentation":{"posr1":"As always a riveting read, even though 600 pages will glide you through, a superb calls presentation, drives you through emotions, enthrall you with spectacle presentations , emotional ride through the a historical characterization..","posr2":"I simply stop reading any other book for a week or so as I was still in the thoughts. The presentation of Amish was amazing I red all the books with in a week as I can't able to do any works with out completing them. As usual flipkart at its best in delivery.","positive":2},"word":{"posr1":"i have only one word wow.. this is the last book of the Shiva trilogy and also more than 600 pages but after reading first two i completed it only in 3 days, while in case of last 2 it take me around 1 month to complete. end was ready unpredictable. i never thought about this end. a good & interesting book","positive":1},"characters":{"posr1":"WMDs and Bawas feature in the last of the triology. Story drags in many places and peppered with stilted conversations and one dimensional characters. Amish is a hard worker but not adept in the art of story telling. After all the hype and OST etc ..a let down.","negr1":"After waiting for this book & finally getting to read it, I was so satisfied! The book continues in the style of the previous 2 of the series. Questions are raised & answered, the characters become slightly more philosophical but also more human... showing a lot more emotions. Obviously, The Evil is found & destroyed but the journey is more exciting than anticipated.","negr2":"Got my copy yesterday....but its not signed as promised by flipkart... :( But nevz cant stop reading.....As ususal amish has done a great job...the plot n characters are such that u cant stop thinking about book when you have other mundane things to do...oh i am gonna hate my job till i complete this book.....Two thumbs up for \" the oaths of vayuputras\"..........","negative":10,"positive":1},"philosophical":{"posr1":"Disappointed with the content of the book. The first book had good philosophical ending. 2nd book had lot of good twists. This does not have either and ending seems very much abrupt.","positive":1},"writing":{"negr1":"A very bad end to a very great start how can u kill satii at the end this was uncalled for. and novel was very lengthy and so boring this was very unexpected. guys please dont waste your time i don't think anybody would have expected such poor writing from amish","negative":1},"wars":{"negr1":"A good start in this 3rd part with lots of aggression expected but An unexpected climax with lots of small wars in between...if you love mythology and wars ...shiva trilogy will be the one ...overall a good sequel by amish..Now i became a die hard fan of SHIVA....","negative":1},"disappointment":{"negr1":"Amish clearly lost the plot with this 3rd book. I really liked the first 2 but the 3rd book was a huge disappointment. The title \"The Oath of the Vayuputras\" was totally inappropriate, the cover page, unlike the first 2 books, was disappointing.....wonder if he will ever be able to recreate his magic....","negr2":"The narration and characters are excellent. The ending is little bit disappointment. The first two part have nice interest, which is reduced on third party. Certain characters could have more jsutification.","negative":3},"potential":{"negr1":"I think the first was best, but this is great too. Narration is good, but the story had such great potential. Could've been better.","negative":1}}
