The only shocking point is that it is part of a three book series which i got to know when i finished this book. I was disappointed as i had to buy an other book to continue the story. The story is not worth 3 books i felt.","negative":1},"characters":{"posr1":"well done job by Jeffery!! wow its an awesome book n best part about the book is it gives the insight story from all the important characters of the book.. enjoyed reading every bit of the book..!","posr2":"A very nice book with extra-ordinary plot and story.
