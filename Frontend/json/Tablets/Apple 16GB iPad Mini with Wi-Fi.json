{"player":{"posr1":"1) It will not let you transfer files except iTunes which needs to be installed in your PC. 2) It does not support video formats except mp4 and m4v niether it has a free player like MxPlayer in android. 3) Battery problems after an year. This is from my personal experience. If you still want to go for Apple products then its your take.","positive":1},"resolution":{"posr1":"nice apple product..wish it would have larger screen like ipad 2.good resolution..nice for reading ebooks..playing games..but some apps are useless without presence of wifi..","negr1":"Cons - No retina display ( very low resolution) Still On A5 chip No Siri (Even iPod touch 5G Has got Siri Cost (with 3k more you can buy iPad 2 ) Not the best 7 inch tab yet,wait for iPad mini 2 which will come with retina display.","negr2":"I have purchased last oct 13 and using it rough and tough.

This mini is too good handy and awesome performance :) Apple tusi great ho !!!!","negr1":"Bought this on EMI a few days back for gifting to the wife. Excellent product, though i'm yet to find proper use for it apart from the novelty factor. Smooth screen performance, as expected from apple.","posr2":"The timing and the delivery of the product was as per schedule and as promised. The performance of the product is also very good considering that this is my first experience with an Apple product. However at times (it's been just 1 month that I have purchased) the applications hang at times. Apart from that there are no problems with it.","negative":1,"positive":2},"battery":{"posr1":"Worth spending on iPad mini.Amazing screen quality and excellent battery life.And as always,flipart is at its best on delivering.","positive":1},"games":{"posr1":"Brilliant device cool fast great mind blowing created battery life superb apps great store can play beautiful games and hd videos great face time and front camera and back camera with great can even use great photo booth","positive":1},"screen":{"posr1":"Don't even think about anything else. Absolutely the best tab money can buy. Just wish the screen was a tad better.","negr1":"Funny that this outdated product is still selling. not even 200ppi screen. People will laugh if you use such an old technology in public. Plus it strains your eyes because of the bad screen. It is even selling above rs10,000 Really Funny. Had it not been gifted I would have never thought apple made such low grade products too. Update also slowed this down.","posr2":"As usual flipkart delivered it on time and awsm packaging..And i got it for 19K in happy hour deal by flipkart..Worth every penny.

Pros: Light weight, Slim Design, Nice Camera.","negative":1,"positive":1},"quality":{"posr1":"The iPad mini does everything the larger iPad does ! The build quality is spectacular and the mini feels as solid as a rock. Compared to its Android competition, the iPad mini has a bigger more usable screen.
