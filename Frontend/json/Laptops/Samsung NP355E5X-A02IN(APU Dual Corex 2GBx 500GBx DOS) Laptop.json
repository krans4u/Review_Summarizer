{"workload":{"posr1":"The product is overall good. The delivery by flipkart was done realy fast. The processor is quite slow but handles basic workload pretty well.Absolutly not recommended for gaming although small time pass games paly without glitches. Sound and display are quite gud. Overall a good buy for 20k. But go for a faster processor.","positive":1},"price":{"negr1":"1. Very good performance. 2. Looks stylish and trendy. 3. And good product in cheap price.

But performance is slow and some time wifi not working correctly(not detected wifi signal). So one second turn on both wireless router and Laptop Wifi after that wifi work correctly.","posr2":"Really superb performance..good battery backup...4 usb slots...good camera quality...2 in 1 ear phone socket....I installed windows 7 and ran crackgen to make it fully activated...my laptop is at its best in this budget....my purpose is to watch movies and browse and games...i think 90 % people will not use a laptop for more than these...","negr2":"Won't say much, won't waste time. Anyone looking to burn â\u201a¹ 20k, you will be pleasured. The performance is horrible, I don't know, but I think my first Pentium 4 PC was on par with this, which I used some ten years ago. AMD is ......... leave it.","negative":2,"positive":2},"battery":{"posr1":"Really superb performance..good battery backup...4 usb slots...good camera quality...2 in 1 ear phone socket....I installed windows 7 and ran crackgen to make it fully activated...my laptop is at its best in this budget....my purpose is to watch movies and browse and games...i think 90 % people will not use a laptop for more than these...","positive":1},"processor":{"negr1":"The product is overall good.
