{"silver":{"negr1":"Envy is a wonderful laptop. A high end CPU with Nvidia GPU. ENERGY STAR certified. Aluminum body in modern silver","negative":1},"display":{"posr1":"Its an excellent laptop. The Full HD display is awesome. I am a programmer and have installed all the IDEs and never faced any heating issues or slow performance. The machine looks elegant. It will take some time getting used to trackpad. Flipkart experience is always exceptional. Always amaze me unexpected pleasant surprises.","positive":1},"adapter":{"negr1":"This notebook has great specs & works like a charm. Only let down is that there is no SSD or mini-SSD card which could have really complemented the hardware. Also, wanted to buy a spare power adapter for home to avoid carrying the supplied power adapter but the same is not available with HP India. This is serious as if the original supplied one gets damaged, there is no ready replacement available.","negative":1},"memory":{"negr1":"Delivery within 20 hours that too on sunday. awsomeee...:) Always great service from flpkart.... i havent used this product as today only it got delivered. but one thing to say u can't get nething better than this..... latest processor huge memory great graphics.... jus one word... awsomeeee:)","negative":1},"performance":{"negr1":"Its an excellent laptop.
