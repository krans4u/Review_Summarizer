Samsung NP355E5X-A02IN(APU Dual Corex 2GBx 500GBx DOS) Laptop@@@Best price and good power backup upto minimum 4 to 6hrs at the time of using internet. Without internet power backup is greater than above 6hrs. But performance is slow and some time wifi not working correctly(not detected wifi signal). So one second turn on both wireless router and Laptop Wifi after that wifi work correctly.
have been using this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and the experience has been quite good... only problem is the laptop attracts fingerprints so have to be kinda careful about the same.
Won't say much, won't waste time. Anyone looking to burn â‚¹ 20k, you will be pleasured. The performance is horrible, I don't know, but I think my first Pentium 4 PC was on par with this, which I used some ten years ago. AMD is ......... leave it.
Hi, I am using the laptop for the past 2 months. It is excellent laptop under 20 k budget. Just need to add 4 gb ram and it rocks.
Good Laptop best for normal use best deal for the price tag you can use this for your day to day work this is not for the programmer
Pros: 1. Basic browsing , No Gaming, Laptop. 2. best battery back up... 4 hrs with out charger. Cons: 1. Cannot open more application, processor will get down -No response. 2. I upgrade the another 2 gb ram in external slot. 3. panel the worst...
You cannot expect much for 17K. Built quality and performance is average. Dont consider buying it if you travel a lot with a laptop along with you. However, its perfect for home use.
Product is working fine for me.. i bought this 2 months ago at Rs.18,490 and upgrade it with 4GB RAM.. i recommend it for ppl who r buying laptop for only entertainment purpose other wise leave this product and go for Dell or Hp laptops, but at this price i cant get any laptop in market with this config.. overall for me its value for money! ;)
I needed a laptop with basic features, nothing too fancy or expensive. This one meets my requirements perfectly. I am very satisfied with the product. Thanks to Flipkart for making it so easy to buy good quality products online and with the full assurance of high quality customer service.
nice service..satisfied..great performance Thank you flipkart.thank you seller ..on time delivery............ :)
being a first time buyer of laptop,i am very satisfied with the product.samsung provides helpline service also which can help you in case of any technical problem.at first it took me by surprise, when i switched on the laptop as the product when comes with DOS, that is you need to load any software like windows 7,8 etc. to operate the computer, which comes at additional cost.then to operate the internet you need datacard/wifi/landline etc.which is again an additional cost. so always figure out the additional costs before buying the product.But this product can be purchased with no worries from flipkart despite being an online store.i was also worried to purchase the product online , but not now anymore.
The product is overall good. The delivery by flipkart was done realy fast. The processor is quite slow but handles basic workload pretty well.Absolutly not recommended for gaming although small time pass games paly without glitches. Sound and display are quite gud. Overall a good buy for 20k. But go for a faster processor.
We bought this almost 20 days back now and not able to use the product as it is getting hang always. We visited the Samsung Service station where it worked for few minutes and when we started using it again, it started giving same problem. We are clueless on how to get this issue fixed ??
This is dual core processor pc, you will repent over your purchase Electronics products are supposed to work for at least 3 years.. and I think in first year ..you will surely regret over buying this one,,, expt that Samsung is landmark in its devices, so oyu can sure about the overall performance, at least this device will not start dying, after a rugged use, but due to old dual core processor it will start lagging.
The Laptop is good which i bought in recent days. Received in 3 Business days. Installed Windows 8 Operating System and it is working good. As of now not facing any problems and need to check the performance at a later point. Any how, the product is very nice.
1. Very good performance. 2. Looks stylish and trendy. 3. And good product in cheap price. Thanks flipkart.
I purchased this laptop one year back from flipkart..now it became useless for me...performance is very slow..back panel broken ,cd/dvd drive not working....i won't recommended this Product to any one..better add some more cost and choose better one instead of wasting money on useless product
I use this laptop primarily for coding, surfing and watching movies. I may not be an average user, but here is my take on the laptop. Pros: 1. Ubuntu 12.04 works out of the box :P. The wireless and graphic drives work without any extra effort. 2. 15.6in Anti reflective screen. 3. Around 4 hrs of battery life for basic net surfing in wifi + coding. Cons: 1. Memory can be bottleneck if you are in the habit of opening many tabs in the browser simultaneously. You get only 1.5G of your RAM for the applications. The rest (384MB) is taken by the graphic card I guess. 2. High definition videos (1080p videos) can be a bit sluggish. For example: 1080p videos in youtube will have some choppiness. But hey, it's not a super expensive laptop. Overall I am satisfied with the laptop. Good performance for an entry level laptop.
I bought it for my grandfather, for mostly accounting work using Tally ERP. Since i did all the installation of OS and all, i did get a chance to test the system. The system performs well, is fast enough for a normal user/ms office and other tasks. BR movies play smoothly in VLC. For all the programmers out there, this is a boon. A 15.6" under 19000 (i bought it in 18450). I installed Visual Studio 2012 and along with that, SQL Management Studio, and run them simultaneously. Since these two softwares are huge as far as memory and processing is concerned, the system showed a decent performance. In short, i did not have to wait while building the projects in VS2010. If in case you need more multitasking, you can add another DDR3 RAM in the empty slot, and it would be a cheap yet powerful upgrade. This comes with DOS, so you save about 5 grands for the OS. I installed Win 7 Ultimate........without spending that 5 grand......you know what i mean. ;) If you don't do much gaming and extensive image or video editing, go for this one. It also comes with dedicated ATI graphics of approx 348 MB. So thats cool.
Good product from samsung. value for money Got it from fllipkart Windows 7 working fine. A good product for simple applications.
I was surprised to see the build quality on this one.. It looks stunning, and more like a 30-40k laptop... Also, I installed windows 7 ultimate on this machine, and runs it beautifully. I needed this one for daily office work, and i must say this is the best you can buy at this range. The display is perfectly balanced, I kinda liked the color output more than my Dell Studio 15. Keyboard not that great, but i guess, it suits the price. All in all, great product! Best you can get at this price. ! And, yeah, Flipkart One day guaranty - Superb !
I have this laptop from last 1.5 years and it does the job perfectly. Boots up quickly, screen is very bright and can be easly seen in direct sun also. Speakers are good, the best part is the battery life. When left idle it can last for weeks without charging. On normal usage (including watching HD movie for 3 hours) gives 7-8 hours of backup. I have left it overnight with songs playing and still had a lot of battery left. Looks are good and will not catch fingerprint as its matte. Has all the connecting options like HDMI etc. Keyboard is very sooth and overall the laptop feels premium, the build quality is very good. Agree its a bit slow but is value for money, especially if you are going to use it for web browsing, using word, powerpoint and watching movies.
Really superb performance..good battery backup...4 usb slots...good camera quality...2 in 1 ear phone socket....I installed windows 7 and ran crackgen to make it fully activated...my laptop is at its best in this budget....my purpose is to watch movies and browse and games...i think 90 % people will not use a laptop for more than these...
Pros: Great build quality for the price. Doesn't look cheap by any standards. The trackpad and the keyboard are quite sturdy. Overall great feel Cons: Within the first 30 minutes of using the machine I realized how horrible its performance was. It feels like you are using a 5 year old system. Installing windows took me over 2 hours! As soon as I start opening a couple of applications, it starts freezing. Overall: Don't cheap out. Spend a couple of more thousand bucks and get a i3 or i5 system. Its much more than worth it.
Its an awesome under 20000/-. I have purchased this laptop 4 months ago from a dealer (Not from Flipkart) at 19200/-. The processor is really fast & the screen resolution is unmatched. People who has budget less then 20000/- , just go for it. There is no complaint at all according to my experience. Only one cons is - The driver for this laptop is only supported in Windows 7 OS. Why to pay more bucks when you get everything under 20000/-
The model is a great value for money. 500GB disk space and 2X USB 3.0 ports are not to be expected from a Rs 19000 model. Very nice screen resolution and a great keyboard together with it's stylish look, this product is a killer. I strongly recommend this product for everyone looking for a laptop in under 24000 prize range. Adding extra 2GB RAM will make this laptop at par with lot of other variants which are much costlier that this.
