Angel of the Dark@@@I was skeptical at first, when I saw this book. I just read a sample from the ebook version. But I was hooked from that moment. So, I bought this book and finished reading it in just 2 days ( mind you, that's very rare for me, given I take lot of time to read a novel ). The author had me guessing from the very beginning. But, it's the ending which lends the novel a long lasting feel. You will be left with a faint smile when you finish the book, I can say that much. And the quality of the book was pretty good for the price. Overall I would say, it's a pretty good novel.
If you are really a sidney sheldon fan and you have read most of his work and you truly love it, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. i bought the book just because of sidney sheldon's name, but tilly bagshawe is not giving it justice. i was very disappointed by this books and will not recommend this to anyone.
The novel is good, but when compared to the great writer Sidney Sheldon style of writing, Tilly Bagshawe will realise that she falls short of the gripping narration. that is why the author openly thanks the entire sheldon family for their kindness, love and support. it is tough to be in Sheldon's shoes. At times the story is confusing, since it weaves through many time frames. and the end is not clear. will Matt Daley and Lisa live happily together or is she going to take him for a ride as she did to the others.............the epilogue is kind of vague. Can surely read through, nothing to crib about. strictly for readers who enjoy crime thrillers, for it is gruesome at times. the Angel of death really strikes! vasudha
Absolute thriller loaded with suspense in each page. Reasonably priced and well delivered by Flipkart Team!
this is a good work from sheldon completed by bagshawe and treat for his fans. a good time pass for journeys
This is a good read. Why is it carrying the name Sidney Sheldon, when in no way its closer to his style. This is the first time I am reading Tilly bagshawe, luckily this happens to be a good thriller. The author lacks creativity that is evident, but some how manages to tell a good story.
Unlike the novels of sheldon which had awesome suspense his legacy has not been carried forward properly by tilly billy. there is no suspense and one coul;d easily guess the story.
I am a fan of a different genre of thrillers (more particularly Dan Brown ones), but a good storyline is worth the read. Personally I feel that this story was way too predictive from the beginning. Moreover, the reason of all the killings seemed kind of vague to me. A little stronger hold on the storyline and better description of the motives would lift it. Nevertheless it was a good read specially if you believe in passionate never-ending love more than any thing else.
The book is ok but the end is awesome.. Slam bang ending.. I realized later only that it is not by sidney sheldon but by tilly bagshaw.. it doesnt have the ruthlessness or the intelligence either
is good book at places dragging. overall a good book to read. bought it seeing Sidney sheldons name proved good. another novel were outstanding if compared
I don't know if its the book or if it is me! Sidney Sheldon has started sounding monotonous. I could predict the end almost right at the beginning. And the pace wasn't great either. The book drifts from the main plot at times. Buy only if you're a die-hard Sheldon fan!
This novel is a little slow in terms of pace as compare to other novels of Sheldon. But full of suspense and thrill. Most of the places when you would about to guess the murderer the story shifts to another gear. Worth reading if you love fictional crime based novels.
If you are looking for fast paced book, and have about 4-5 hours to read it in. i would recommend this book. The plot is predictable (I managed to figure it out almost half way), and there is nothing new that the book has to offer. But like I said - if you are in a mood to read something, without using your brains too much, this is the book.
The book is full of suspense. I read the book in a weekend. It was good, but the end was making the reader feel rather betrayed. I would definitely recommend it. If you are a first time Sheldon reader I would recommend you read 'If tomorrow comes' and 'Rage of Angels'. They are his masterpiece.
Not one of the master pieces,I consider "if tommorow comes " a better choice if ur a new to sidney sheldon.but its worth a read as it has all the sidney sheldon stuff and taste..dnt miss it.itll hardly take a day if ur a regular reader..I suggest u try a combo with sme other book so dat u save sme money.
I would rate it sa average. Though it is a good book to be procured at such a cheap price, it still falls short of the expectations I had when I bought it. The kind of book you would pick up on a Sunday afternoon and read it through the night.
Well, its not a boring paperback....but its yet not extraordinary. Would have liked to rate at 3.5 or something like that..No need to compare with the Legendary Sidney Sheldon... It keeps you interested, but seems to predicitive. Kind of an anticlimax at the end. I think the book story was stretched over than the material content. But nonetheless a good timepass, nice and familiar sidney sheldon style simple and easy going english writing style, not one of those modern thrillers complicated brain-breaking complicated content...
Being a hard-core fan of fastly paced thrillers, finished the book in a night. Not exactly impressed with the way story turns ! There seems to no real twist, of which Sheldon is a master, till around 140-160 pages of the book. The next page and page after that, all seem to be quite predictive. But yes, as others also put it, last page is the real shocker but not entirely unexpected. Looking at the price it seems to be an ok bargain though. All in all, expected some thing better. To say the least, I have read better from "The Master" !!
This is an excellent book. As it is Sheldon is unpraisable, but this worthy of a book. excellent plot, contents and also the page quality & printing. The publishers no doubt done a great job. Thanks to them as well. So full marks from me.
thanks to flipkart for delivering my book on time& for the pretty bookmark!! the book is as good as any other sheldon's...no disappointments!!! it does not fail to hold our attention and interest for a real long time...a must read one!!
First of all I must mention that I received the book in 2 days ! Thanks Flipkart ! About the Book: Yes, the book is so engrossing ! I read it in 3 days ! Only Last few Pages are boring ! But the Novel is MUST READ for people who love suspense and Thriller !
The last Sydney Sheldon I read was almost 6 years ago. Seemed that I had exhausted all he had to offer, and with no new titles coming up, I moved on to other authors. Tilly has done justice to Sheldon's story, to a certain extent. As written below, by many other readers, that there is not much of a suspense left after a few chapters, and you can kind of guess who the culprits are, but it still intrigues you, as to why they are doing so, and how will they be caught, or if the crimes will ever be proved or not. My heart goes out to the character - Matt Daley, who (in my opinion) gets the worst deal of the lot, while the Angel soars high. It is a bit irritating though, the way every male character seems to be smitten by the Angel and her good looks and naiveness, even when the truth is evident. The end is quite predictable, except off course the last page. That leaves you wondering for a while. Has justice truly been served ????? Is the victim, REALLY a victim or a harbinger of Death ?? and so on. It’s not a bad bargain though, considering I could hardly keep it away when I reached the last chapters. It is not a great work of literature(like Doyle or Dickens, if you are expecting so), but a typical Sydney novel, some satisfy you, some leave you in doubt, and some leave you wanting more . All in all, at the Flipkart prices, it is a fair bargain, and yeah I wouldn’t buy it if the prices were to be any higher. I'd recommend it for train journey. :)
First review ever. If its Sidney's, Its "The best". I am a huge fan of Sidney and really love to read the story. Read Memories of Midnight and The Doomsday Conspiracy so was looking for another Sidney's best and I assure this novel also maintain what he always does best in his novels. The plot of the story is really good and how can I forget that I received this novel in just two days after I ordered it from the flipkart. Really fast shipping and at very best price. You can't get a better deal on a new cover from any online website or any shop near to your place.
This book is being sold everywhere with a lie-- that it is written by Sheldon. The author is Tilly Bagshawe. Having said that, it is a decent read, but I was disappointed by the end. It leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.
This is simply not in the category of the earlier Sidney Sheldon book may be for the simple reason that this one is not written by him. This is an extrapolation like the other books written after his death. I did not like it at all if I compare it with the Sands of time, Windmills of God and Master of the Game.
The way its written, the whole plot can be visioned as a motion picture and then you just can't stop reading. Super thrilling! Its like watching the Movie -Orphan :P The effect of the plot stays with you for awhile.
its really a good book...book lovers will definitely love this book...there is a new suspense in almost every chapter...and to conclude its a typical sidney sheldon type--suspense murder romance sex betrayal ....go for it guys..worth purchasing... and thanks to flipkart i received this book within one day of ordering...
Wow! An amazing thriller from Mr. Sheldon. I have enjoyed this book a lot great plot. It was Just brilliant. An American Police officer who failed to catch the criminal responsible for a brutal murder of billionaire and violent rape of his wife, joins the Interpol. A person whose farther was the victim in the earlier case ask him to re-investigate into the case as similar killing were taking place. The book was in great condition. Thanks to Flipkart!
a nice work from sidney. the book's story line up and suspense keep u bonded to it. Although i personally do not found the end suspense much interesting. there could have been more twists. overall nice book
A typical Sheldon stuff . It's not difficult for a keen reader to understand the plot only after 60/70 pages....still you'll continue reading and after some 200 pages..feel like yawning. The concluding part has marred the whole thing.
I do not have any feedback for the book as I did not receive the book from Flipkart!!! it has been 20 days and yet I am to receive the books that I ordered, a very poor service for a buyer who has been a regular purchaser on the site, when I call the customer service they tell me it will take another 7 days for the book to be delivered!! what a poor service for a pre paid order, I would never purchase ever again on this website.
The story is predictable, and i could understand the entire "Mystery" in the first 50 pages itself, i was just dragging myself through the book hoping for a different ending but no luck! Don't buy the book cos you will be disappointed by the weak plot..I had a lot of expectations when i started off with the book but all in vain...
Wonderful xciting novel it gives immense pleasure to read the novel. One must read this novel. I liked it very much and the writer has done full justice. Perfect starting and perfect ending. One can fisnish it in 3days.
I picked it up for the 'Sidney Sheldon' Legacy.....the book turned out to be such a disaster. From the first 50 pages you can place the whole story and so takes the fun out of reading. The rest of the book was such a drag. The plot is typical 'Sidney Sheldon' but the presentation is not him at all. As a die hard Sheldon fan this book was not up to my expectations :(
Tilly tries hard to imitate Sidney's writing style - does it well with murder & sex scenes. But, the story line itself is not that strong enough. I felt that the plot picked up a bit after 80 pages or so, but eventually started losing interest in the read. And also, the ending is not impressive enough either.
Like most Sheldon's books this one too is full of sex, blood and money. It’s just amazing how he can write so many books in the same genre and still keep us interested. This one too is a master class. Once you have completed about 40-50 pages, it’s hard to keep the book down even for a second. You just fall in love with the Angel (the lady protagonist), however it’s just the last 3 pages which kills the whole excitement of having completed the book... It’s just a personal opinion. I would still consider this a wonderful read
This is excruciatingly long and very unnecessary at that. I am giving a star as there is no lesser rank. I have read enough Sheldon or similar thriller books to clearly say this is by far the worst I have read in the recent times.
I think the title says it all. Its not good ending and that spoils the full story. It's like typical movie. I will recommend not to buy this book and waste your time. The story starts well, then it keeps on dragging. And at the end i feel like when will the book end. The investigation which goes in US looks like we are staying in old age where there is no law and anyone can close a case.
The book easily matches the quality of Sheldon's previous thrillers. The plot is good, the story is fast-paced and the overall effect is quite fascinating. there are few areas which may have been explained by the writer in a better manner. I would recommend every Sheldon lover to buy and read this one
The story is good but quite predicatable (at least some part) and has some turning points. All the characters are well connected to each other. I like the Mumbai Part. The Taj Legacy! Court darama was good. (Never thought of that in the book.) Anyhow it is the page turner. You want to know all the time what will happen nxt!
As the book was reaching its end i got very excited to learn the motive/background/drive of the killer. But as the book came to an end I was pretty disappointed!!! :( It seemed very incomplete! Like it was wrapped up for the heck of it
It came on 2nd day due to the best service provided by FLIPKART!! From the very first chapter it mesmerised me and is a real page turner. If u like crime and mystry in one...IT is a MUST BUY!! The best thriller by Sidney Sheldon Tilly Bagshawe..
just read the book and have mixed bag of feeling!! the book was typical sidney sheldon's nicely laid plot although end was bit predictable! followed by classic court room trial!! and as always 'out of the world' ending!! I'm a big fan of sidney sheldon and tilly have tried her best to follow his footprints!! but at the end i would say that this book wont't fail to give you goosebumps!!
I have also read the other books of tilly bagshawe, and this one is better than others, nicely woven, very captive during first half , in the end it's slightly boring but story really moves fast. I really liked this book as i am a big fan of sidney sheldon and it was a good attempt by tilly bagshawe to revive that magic again.... it was not best but better for sure.
