Let Us C 13th Edition@@@i initially wanted to study Java but was adviced to study C and then C++ before moving to Java. This book really helped me and i strongly recommend this book for any newcommer to programming. The book teaches the basics and moves forward with examples as well as sample exercises. i strongly recommend this book. Peace
Excellent for those students who are from non-IT background. Flipkart's delivery was over impressive. Looking forward to hire Flipkart again.
this book is very ideal with beginners and can build confidence of writing a program and removes fear of c programming................if u miss this then you are missing alot
this is most simple book for programming beginners who have no basic knowledge of programming. easy language better than E Balaguruswamy. Despite more contradictions about authenticity and usefullness of this book it is good. If u have a knowledge about programming then purchase The C Programming language by D Ritchi.
i have read just 2 3 units and i found it really very easy to understand text in very simple , it is highly comprehensible , and things given are in a very basic manner yet very effective, i would recommend this book for all programming beginners..
this is an excellent book for learning C. Author uses simple language and concepts are explained very well. It also has a number of exercise problems at the end of every chapter for practicing. Definitely worth buying it.
this is worth for money. Great codes in simple language makes this the best book for reference ! kudos Yashawant Kanetkar.
this is one of the best books on c programming.. step by step thorough guide for beginners.. you will get almost everything about c.. yashavant kanetkar is a great writer.. i actually read the 12th edition ... i don't think there'll be much changes.. i recommend this for everyone..
this is one of the best book by yk for beginners .i strongly recommend this book...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This book is good for new comers who see C for the first time...it educates on all topics...though the issue I presume is that it clearly is an informative read but as any author not trying to touch the grey areas, this book does it's level best to bring out the best of the non-intuitive parts of C language.
Good read and latest edition covers all topic well. Before any serious programming and big reference books, this book would not scare you from programming. It is good for engineers when they want to migrate to Matlab or any other scientific softwares.
The author seems to understand the mentality of indian student, the writing style is very much what indian student can understand ,... that is very simplified. I have bought this book 3rd edition ,i had many editions of this book but every time Author brings in some new stuff. Sometime get rid of little old ones. Still all in all very good for beginners.
Let me buy, let us C Let me read, Let us C Let me work with let us C Let me tell u this is the best book for beginner available in market for C. Go for it without hesitation
Like the title says, this book is bad. It uses the Turbo C compiler and doesn't teach ANSI standard code (Turbo C can't run ANSI code). Avoid this book at all costs. If you want an easy to understand book, check out C The Complete Reference. If you have experience in programming, read The C Programming Language by Ritchie (the inventor of C) and Kernighan. The book deserves a rating of 0. Flipkart, you have a ton of programmers in your organization. You should know better to not keep such books in stock :-|
I ordered this book on Flipkart and it was delievered within 48 hours. Flipkart has provided the awesome service as always. About the book: The book is good for beiginners. Providing primary information. E Balagurusamy has written a better book I would like to say. You can refer this book along with The programming in ANSI C By E Balagurusamy. But you can not use this only book for complete understanding of C. But yes one thing about this book that the advanced concepts given in this book like Programming with Windows & Network Programming are the key features for the book. VERDICT: A very good reference book. Ankit Baghadia
This is very useful book for freshers. because i have not proper basic knowledge about computer. even then i am understanding and getting knowledge through this book and covered 30% in just 15 days.you all could not imagine i am just metric pass and if i can understand then i think every one can do it. so please do not go away for c language.
Let us C is always good for a new beginner in C programming specially. the delivery of book by Flipkart was nice but the books sucks.. the books outer cover looks like it has already been used by someone. it makes me feel that i had been cheated by Flipkart. so better avoid this book to buy in flipkart.
The book might be good for experienced C programmer especially for the purpose of cracking objective questions. It really helps refining the basic details of C language e.g. operator precedence etc. . However, the newbies might never want it to have it as his/her first book. For the first reading the following book is advised : http://www.flipkart.com/c-programming-language-ansi-version-2nd/p/itmdytcjjypxjvwf?pid=9788120305960&affid=kunalshopp This is very standard book and written by DENNIS RITCHIE himself(the inventor of C language). This books gives better understanding and builds better foundation . All the best.
Very good book those who started in programming, Not only this book find useful for making syntax and narration of language easy but also develop some logical skill through working programs and logic written in this book. Flipkart Delivery is always up to the mark & they use to deliver happiness with the product we order.
Not for professionals, Language has been explained irrespective of there professional usage. Even i feel more of the term to confuse fresher about programming language. I dont understand why this book is so famous when we talk about C. There are so many other good books avialable.
i'm a BE student studying C as my 1st progm// language. It's really nice & helpful 2 have this book.+POINTS: 1. very good for beginners. 2. lots of data for complicated output related programs. -POINTS: 1. level of detail is quite high, but no. of completely writtten programms are very low in this book.
A very good book for BTECH C.S.E. students......Let your personality shine through, but it's equally important to provide facts to back up your opinion. Nothing is worse than inaccurate information. If you're not really sure, research always helps.
I remember the 4th edition of this book that I have purchased around 11 years ago and started my programming and still I dare to give the review today. At that time I was a lay person to computers and programming. Believe me I was able to start with computers and programming on all my own. I also studied the 5th edition of the book later. Best C programming book to start with. C programming is the defacto standard for any one to get introduced and learn programming and this book does it in excellent way. Most striking features of the book (4/5th edition) are: 1. Perfect and straight to the point explanation. 2. Indepth coverage of c and some important concepts of computer hardware 3. The chapters 11 onwards are explained very well for all intricacies of language. 4. Puzzling and interesting exercises at end of every chapter for a newbie 5. DOS interrupts / services and hardware interaction through C. 6. Programming on bits / bytes, extremely useful appendices at the end of book. 7. The most important 8086 addressing scheme explained. I have also seen that from 7th edition onwards the chapters on hardware interaction, interrupts and some appendices are deleted. New chapters on C programming on Linux and Windows are added. Anyways I enjoyed all the C programming on my old computer. Suggest every one to read the 4th or 5th edition of this book, but its not available. Still not a problem, go through the present available version and you will gain a lot. Also one can go through another and most important book on C, titled The C programming language.
Nice for basic programming Let Us C 8183331637 As usual flipkart did its best in delivering the product one can easily learn basic logic building with this book. Let us c is good enough ...for beginners
Although easy to read, this book is full of factual errors. Certain features of C are implementation dependent, this fact needs to be addressed. All books by Yashavant Kanetkar should be avoided. I recommend K&R, which costs almost as much as this one (low price edition).
English language shaktay jamon amara "A B C" boi portay hay tamoni "Valo kore C Programming Shiktay Holay Let Us C portey hobe". Ai boi tatey Kanetkar sir darun sundar vabe sahaj-sarol vabe sadharon studenter bodhogommo kore tula6a.
This book may be very basic and simple for Computer-related studies, but for other studies like Mechanical and Civil, this book helps to understand what C program is. I found this book to be useful, as I am from the Mechanical Engineering background, and I found all the basic commands and other topics related to C, explained in a very simple manner.
I bought this book from flipkart this is one of best book ive read by yeshavant.. very nice explained and written. Go with this book if you want to start with C.. this book also cover linux to windows GUI programming.. using GTK.
I started my programming career with BASIC and after learning about 10 programming languages I still remember the wonder of those days while I was reading 'Let Us C'. I loved it and got a deep realization of how to write a good book. No matter which technology you use or which coding style you follow, there is always something beyond it and that is the ability of writing a captivating textbook. I completed this book like a Dan Brown thriller and jumped to another Kanetkar book. I don't think I was wrong. Now as a .NET programmer I CLAIM MY RIGHT to say that 'LET US C' is the best book ever written which can really make you to be with C and it is the only book that can make you fall in love with C. "It all depends how we C it!" - The introduction starts like this and the author is really successful in converting 'C' from a noun to a verb. Learning 'C' is the most thrilling experience in a programmer's life and it is really like an action. Whenever you are in some coding organisation and some of your colleague comes to with with some difficult coding issue, you tell him, "Let me C if I can solve it." Let Us C is not only a book if is also the name of a passion, a passion for the computer science, a tribute to the father of all modern computing technology and be it on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, Symbian or iOS, C is the only thing that made it possible. Today when many schools start to teach programming directly through C++ or Java, one big question really remains unanswered will those students ever be able to do any sensitive programming that can give us the smoothness of iOS or the majesty of Linux. I want to advise one who is really eager to learn modern programming to follow this path... Let Us C > Understanding Pointers in C > Data Structures Through C (Optional) > Let Us C++ >> {Then choose any of C#, Java or Visual C/C++ depending on your need} For Java - Java The Complete Reference For C# - Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step By Step > Wrox Professional C# 4.0 For VC/C++ - Visual C++ Programming (again Kanetkar) > Wrox Begining Visual C++ 2010 . . . Then anything your passion wants and now you are capable of finding a 'good programming book' by yourself.
Really nice book ... all important aspects of C language are there .. not with a detailed information but its quite enough. elaboration on some topics is still lacking. language is simple and very understanding too. not having a lot of programs so you have to go through its solutions also i will not say that you will be professional after going through this book ..but you can get a good hold on the basic's ... i will recommend this book ...go through it learn the good things form it !!
This is the best book u will find for learning C language. This book starts from the most basic level, therefore helps one of those who don't even know the abc of C language. In short i will say this book of Yashwant Kanetkar sir is so good that u won't require a teacher to teach u this topic. u may do it yourself. And no need to say anything about the service of flipkart. Its awesome.
I am a seasoned programmer with over 10 years of working only on C. I have written parts of the Linux OS too. So trust me when I say this, I still refer to this book now and then. This book helped me gain an understanding of how to write C code in a pragmatic way.
Firstly I didn't buy it from Flipkart but would like to review this book. Kanetkar's work here is for only novice script kiddies (lame example though). In spite of being a popular book in India it is a pseudo quality book. No ANSI or C99 standards at all. One may read it as a story book but if one needs serious C reference, go for ANSI C by Balagurusamy or The Complete Reference (C) by Schildt. As to a note for all the teachers, please don't suggest this book to fresh CS/IT student just because you lack wider perspective or interest to work with standards.
An upto date product by Flip kart. Personally I found the book quite helpful.From c basics to decision control and further to functions and pointers, the theory is thoroughly explained. The book comes with a plethora of examples therefore making it very easy to understand for beginners. And as always delivery by flip-kart is quick.
Hmm...Now this is the book a computer student or a newbie must have as it helps clear concepts or learn C at his/her own pace.A good book with many illustrative examples to help clear concepts and their practical use.An overall good book to have.Again a good job, Flipkart!
Awesome!! Awesome!! Awesome!! Simple language make this book a great and easy to understand reading. The feel of reading is awesome. Each and every topic is described or i say narrated very clearly and step wise. For beginners like me its an awesome book. Now i can easily understand other books on C after getting through 'Let us C'. Its a great buy...
The book is considered to be the classic in c programming..... And why not, after all it is written by a professional with huge knowledge.......So every one siting there and thinking to buy or not must bye it, and should be possessed by every one who wants to be a IT professional [profession in programming]...... I also came with such person who says that they cant understand the book............. I would say either they have not paid much attention in reading the book ... or..... are s**t head.......... TRUST ME THE BOOK IS VERY EASY 4 BEGINNERS & EASY TO UNDERSTAND...
I have gone through this book so many times and i learnt new thing every time. I know whoever are disliking it, are never gonna meant for C. I know, its quite comprehensive. And if you are the one who wants logic and reason behind every syntax and code, then you can go for it. It truly love this book and recommended this book for all beginners and intermediates.
I read this book in my first year of B.Tech; and since then developed a repulsion for this. It may teach you basic concepts in C; but do not expect to understand complex topics like pointers. The best book for C is "ANSI C Programming Language" by Late Sir Dennis Ritchie (he created it!).
Well, this book is the best for beginners. Not for programmers of course. This book will help the students understanding the C language. In the book you will find a lot of exercises that will help to understand the language. The language is so simple in this book that everyone can understand by reading only once.
This book is more helpful for beginners of c-programming because it has more simple simple examples after reading of this book only i got clear knowledge on c-language it's true. After reading this book you can read any book you can easily understand the concept. Please kindly don't think that this book is complete reference for c-language it's only for introduction purpose, and also don't think by completing this book you are the master or programmer you have to need more practice to get grip on this language.My opinion is this is excellent book for BEGINNERS ONLY.
This book is followed by most of the engineering students (specially big hit in non-premier colleges) in our country. The reasons may be many: written by an IITian, having lots of code samples (most even dont compile on various compilers) etc etc. But I have found this book really a joke!! Author (and may be your seniors too) may try to convince you that there is nothing beyond this book in this ocean of C but trust me, this book will ruin your career. You will realize that when you will come to professional development in C. This book does not give a damn to best practices to be followed, writing code that will run on all compilers, things to avoid etc. I personally feel that there are thousand other better books then why to blindly chase it, just because many other idiots are following it. I could have given it a zero star for spoiling the career of many but had to go with one.
A great book to start C coding. Topics are excellently organized and very well explained... Highly recommended for those who want to be a good programmer in C. I liked the Linux part a lot but the preface to earlier editions is a bit confusing. Must Buy.. :D
It is an exceptional book where you can start learning from basics . And the experience with FLIP KART is amazing. it is a book that everyone should read. it concentrates more on difficult topics.i got it with in two days
I don't understand why this book is so hugely popular! Its highly harmful if you want to sustain a career in IT. This is a typical example of how you should never write code. It teaches bad programming style...doesn't care about standards and is full of toy examples that do no good when you sit for serious coding. My suggestion (and also suggested by many reputed coders): go for a book called "C programming - a modern approach" by K. N. King (2nd ed.) and when you have grasped the basics and want to delve in deeper, go for the ultimate: "The C programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie. The first book is probably not available as a local print(flipkart has an imported edition, i guess) but you can always get an ebook from... you know where! The second is a classic and is off-course available. Its also pretty cheap here at flipkart (~120 bucks). There's nothing more harmful than bad learning. So, there... Happy learning and happy coding!
Basics of c programming described in simple words. You can finish the whole book in 2 weeks..you wont get bored!!! Recommended only for beginners.. For exam preparations, you may also buy the Let Us C solutions.
This book is nt useful for those who need graphics oriented c lang...............this is just for functions and some simple topics that u read in ur early classes............flipkart delivery status ...as always excellent
this is one of the book, which could be liked even by the beginer or by the master.. the way of writing is in such a way that u will began to feel that yashavant sir is sitting next to u n making every point clear fr u.. really amazing book.. n ofcource amazing delivery by flipcart at amazing rate.. i used the word amazing so many times na.. ;-) but it deserves too.. :-)
This book is a must for students doing BCA or aspiring for MCA and the contents are really simple. This was my first order on flipkart and i got this book delivered in 1 and Half day!! these flipkart guys really are amazing..excellent packing even for a book!!
Currently I m pursuing MCA still Let Us C is as favourite as when I read it doing my BCA. It seems Someone is narrating a story of C language.Language is so simple. I m loving it, will love it for ever n ever.
This book explains the language of C going into the very details of everything...It's a nice book for someone who is new to the language and is starting his journey into the big C world..Not for the programmers though!!
