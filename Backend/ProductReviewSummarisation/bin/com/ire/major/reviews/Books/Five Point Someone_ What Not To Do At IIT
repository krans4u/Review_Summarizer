Five Point Someone_ What Not To Do At IIT@@@I really liked it.It is worth reading and it is fun reading.I was totally taken aback by the simple language used and how the emotions and feelings were let out.It is awesome and I am looking forward for chetan bhagat to write some more.This is my second one of chetan's and I liked it more than I liked One night@call center.
it was superb,.. i love to read this when i started and finished in 2 days,.. simply superb,.. book packing was good,...
Yesterday when i realized that i had not done any thing in maths and have pre board next day.... I made a plan to study in night and thought that after reading few chapters of this book i will start studying and at that time i was on chapter 11 (the gift) and after an hour mom came in my room and scolded me as i was reading a novel but it became so interesting that till 3 AM i woke and finished full book (I started from chapter 11 as previous chapters were already been read by me) I normally can't give huge sitting to novels but this was a master book and even i hided it behind my school book so that mom can't figure out I'm back home after exam (no need to say how bad it went though) and i normally don't give full marks to any product but when i do I mean it and ya if u have watched 3 idiots then don' think you won't enjoy it the way you would have enjoyed if u won't have seen the movie It is different experience don't listen to haters ... they will keep hating BUY IT NOW
A hilarious and engaging one-time read, and strictly not to be followed by students at the IIT! The book definitely has a page-turning drive in it.
I just loved Chetan Bhagat's informal style of writing. There was at least one laugh out loud moment in every 20 pages! Awesome!
I dont recommend this book its baseless and nothing to read about except 3 guys studying in IIT .... This book is like an essay ,,,Waste of time and money !!
best of Chetan bhagat till now .Having all the emotions pitch it perfectly and with excitement in each paragraph.Exact lifestyle,wording,story.Mesmerizing experience while reading..........................must read book!!!!!
Although I read this book a couple of times, still thought I must have a Good Copy of it... One of my Best Reads.
I saw 3 idiots movie before I read this book. It is not exactly the same as this book as rumored. It contains Bhagat's innovative thinking as in all his books
This is a kind of book one must read.. and especially the IITians .! :D Straight forward language, true life happenings and all what it is motivational. I always suggest reading this. Go for it!
This book is awesome.this is the book for everyone student,lover,author.If you are in IIT you should really read FPS.This book is better than 3 idiots.Th is the tale about IIT,love,friend and life.I read this book thrice,but never felt booooored.Ushould read tkis||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I dont need to say anything about the book. As per cover and book condition, i just got the book in 4 days and it is not late as I am living in Cuttack. And condition is great and I dont think u will find any other place with such a good price
Well this is not a Guy de Maupasant..be it the story or the plot. The English usage is not that great either. But then this a read for the masses. A selective mass of people at that. I do not think any person who is NOT an engineer will be able to connect with this story. Its more of a story by your fellow senior..being heard over coffee at his house. Its great. Its fun. Its quite realistic. Surely upholds the plight, situation and lives of engineering students. Great read if you have a broad mentality as to what to expect from this story.
I really can't believe the price @n which I got my book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its just somewhere around 80 rs for a book of price 140.I still can't believe nd moreover I don't know how dealers are managing derive profot from that I really like the service from flipkart
dis one is mindblowingg man............ dfinitely a must read.... its gud fo teenagers.....really gud cb fantastic workkkk umm it shud b read by all.... i completed in just one day......yess one dayy.... and chetan bhagat........blown off man........ it is about 3 frnds one girlfrnd and lots of funnnn
the only chetan bhagat title that was a little sensible. glad to have started reading him from here and hence picked up his second book. the fictional god controlling everything was enteratining but simultaneously seemed so foolish
I started this book after watching 3 idiots . Except raju's falling from the college building there is no similarity. This book is for children who want to improve their language skills. NO STORY AT ALL.IT IS JUST LIKE A BIOGRAPHY OF THREE STUPID COLLEGE FRIENDS WHO STUDY NIGHT AND DAY TO REACH IIT AND THEN BLAME EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR MAKING THEIR LIFE LIKE HELL .SO U NO WHAT THEY DO? THEY STOP STUDYING!!!! If this Is what Indians like I will never read any Indian author bestseller again .
This is a great book for IITans.THe book has a message on it's own while 3 idiots is better than the book.Things that Raj Kumar Hirani has changed in his movie:- Ryan=Rancho,Alok=Raju,Hari=Farhan,Neha=Priya,Virus=Prof. Cherian,Chatur=Venkat(Who plays a minor role). 1.Farhan is in love with Priya not Rancho. 2.Alok wants to become an artist,While in the movie Farhan wants to and becomes a photographer. 3.The thing that Rancho is Phunsukh Wangdu is not at all mentioned in the book. Not only these there are many other changes which you will find out when you read the book...THANK YOU.
I ask myself: 1. Why did I pick this book? 2. Why did I paid for it? 3. Why did I read it? The three mistakes of my life, for choosing five point someone, which is a shit! Weak plot, grammatically also it is just average, nothing golden! And overall, just a 1/5.
One of the best book that i have came across. One of the best books that i have come across in non fiction !! Truly amazing Chetan bhagat is one of the best writers for india today and other books such as revolution 2020 and what young india wants were also nice !
good book to read and must for Indian parents, they will definitely know what the current Indian education system have in and the flaws present in it. Chetan Bhagat has done a great work in bringing out certainly some flaws in IIT's. It discusses various aspects in the livelihood of a student which changes as soon as he enters the most prestigious institute in the country - iit.
This is a great book by Chetan Bhagat. I am reading it and a lot of fun is inside it. Flipccart is also good. It sent it to me vary easily. You should must read. If you are waiting for a lot of fun and knowledge then buy it.
This is the best book to start with if you are a beginner.The narration is simple but very well executed.208 pages of pure fun.The story is grippy and keeps you at toes till the very end.Go Grab this one !!!
Really a wonderful book...It is very much near to the reality as what goes in IIT...along with this it inspires the readers too...As usual no words to explain on the great man,the author Chetan Bhagat he is rocking....so buy it...read it...enjoy it...if you did not understand go watch 3IDIOTS....Ha Ha Ha....
"Five point someone" probably is a very nice book by Chetan Bhagat according to me . It was nice spending my time reading it. It is worth reading it. This is somewhat like the book version of the movie "3 Idiots".
A brillent story, i felt i was in my college again. One must read this book to enjoy his college days :). The characters really attracts you and you feel you are among them while reading this book. Had fun n great funny non sense jokes which always happens with friends
I found chetan bhagat books to read easy ,as it is written like how people speak normally.. fps is a book talks about life IIT though the events and the situation takes place in every college.Felt good to read as I was recollecting memories of my college days. and flipkart made a wonderful deleivery to Virudhunagar (town in TN which is near madurai) and has good discount too..
this is the first time for me to read an english novel...its nice one and stir in our minds especially about grades...i had too became a die hard fan of chetan and i am going to buy his some other works too...
Five point someone is a nice books ..with real heart touching story for youngsters ... feel like to be a engineering student .... Have funnnn n gr8 funny none sense jokes which always happens with frndz.. Its a nice site for online purchasing books n other electronics gadgets ... it deliver the things on time to yr homes.. !! Thanks flipkart..for making the things easy.. :)
You have all the ingredients in here to make even the lamest reality show look like blockbusters. The author starts-off by admitting he lacks the grasp of the basic english language, and with his sloppy langugage and poor, 5th-standard-fail grammer it certainly shows. He might have as well admitted that he was undergoing a lobotomy being performed by a quack while writing this book; because short of that no one can believe this was written by person who has passed Class X. It is so replete with mistakes (and sheer stupidity) that one can barely finish a quarter of the book. Twice the Awesomeness...book kept me engaged.. I started reading this book at 10 PM...finished at 6 in morning...enjoyed a lot...Chetan's one of the best. I recommend everyone to read it...don't go by critics review..some people have habit of always criticizing the things...look at the majority...
Best novel by chetan till now about youngsters... every youngster must read this novel.. dont try to skip this novel,, everything it has.. amazing writing, work.. chetan has the art of writing novels.. not like others that took the pen n start writing anything.. this novel is too good man !! :) :) :)
I read this book thrice. But still whenever i get time i prefer to read this book. Its a superb motivational book for students. Thanks Chethan for writing. Please continue to write such kind of books:):):)
If you haven't read Chetan Bhagat then please start reading and to start with something u have got one. Good explanation of very small events that we often go through our books is something that makes this book so special.Definitely this book explains why Chetan Bhagat is making Indian readers read more English novels. Once again good service by flipkart.Got this book in just two days.
This book is about how Chetan really screwed his life at IIT. It is very ordinary, and anyone who says that it is awesome is simply dumb! However the book does hook you up in the beginning, but slowly it lets you go, and at the end it just kicks you out! The book has an horrible ending. One message is very true that Indian education has to change its way, especially IIT. But the book barely concentrates on that! What it concentrates on is that how 3 hippies bunk classes at day and drink rum at night. One thing should better be noted that, if you are the type that likes good endings and want to think about the book for hours after completing it then this is definitely not you cup of tea, as the end is horrible. Clearly this book is the highest selling English novel of India because of propaganda, nothing else
Being a beginner i was very reluctant to pick this piece of Mr. Chetan Bhagat after his recent so called flop of Revolution 2020. Moreover i was not of him because i came to know about him through Three Idiots Controversy. But after reading this brilliant piece of him i cursed myself to run on conclusion bit early with finding truth. This is novel is something that changed my night habits earlier i used to watch tv for longs hours but during this i switched that of around 10.30 and clings with this. While writing this review i am left with last chapter of this book.
I have read it after watching 3 idiots and I felt that it was really amazing. Some people felt that it is like a science book, but it is the real one. You will realize it is real if you were so clever in the school days. You will see Ryan, Hari, Alok around you if you are learning in engineering college.
It is a awesome book by chetan. i read it at once and enjoyed a lot. i m going to join engineering college next month, so it is of great interest for me to read this book. the Best movie of the year 2009, 3 idiots, was made on this book..!!!
this book kept me thinking all day it is worth a shot it kept me interested in it all the way the threesome have Amazing fun on the campus of IIT.i didn't know that you sold such awesome books for such low price . all of my friends read it after me and all of them loved it i say buy this book if you are seeking for fun on the IIT campus
Already it is bestselling novel but the story seems too fictious n so unreal... the students are in IIT n they behave like they are in local college.. but description of characters are good and however the Aamir Khan starrer 3 Idiots also was a superhit based on this novel...
Chetan Bhagat is quirky, funny, witty and original in his first venture as a writer, it is a must read for every one between the ages of 17 to 22. It is expressive and feels as if it comes straight from the heart. The characters are lively and real, we find them everywhere... The story is equally riveting. Value for money
simple clean & honest writing.....chetan knows heart of young Indian....this novel not going to teach u anything but surely wil push time easily...................................once u start u will wont be keeping it in half...
awesome book....enjoyed reading....just took a half a day to read....felt like i was in Hari's situation.....easy to read book....i recommend you all to read it...the longest day of my life part 3 is the best in the whole book....
i still refuse to believe it the book is frm same author who wrote "three mistakes...." "two states ".....m a huge fan of cb bt dis book iszz just a headche for mee...its more like my science testbook....
i usually dont read books. But when i had to order a course book...it was worth Rs95 and in order to save Rs30 as shipping charge, i searched for the cheapest one present there. So, along with my coursebook, i ordered five point someone. After reading this one ,i can definately say i made the right choice! Amazing book, i must say. And the best part is, being a engineering studentr myself....i can relate myself to this book. I would say its worth reading :)
i have read it after watching 3 idiots.must say chetan had done a great job.much interestng and preety good story.thats why it worked for me.I have become a fan of chetan.Really bro u had a good past.really good.
i had read this book before some 7-8 years back....and had enjoyed a lot.....a fun read....the character are so live that you just lost your self in their story....the one liners are very intuitive...its difficult to say that this is author's debut work.......
Good as per ""The standards of INDIAN AUTHORS. ."" However not so much interesting, Not good as a story but best as a narration.. But at least I can say best book in Indian fiction category after reading books from authors like Durjoy, Ravinder, Preety, Subhasis, Sudeep etc etc...
cb first novel was although nt gud ...bt two states n revolution n three mistakes.....r worth readin bt diszzzz one is jst a waste ..jst meant fr iit nerds to read out..... better to give a miss to it
Reading "Five point someone" is five crore worth, thanks for flip cart to provided at discount rate. Type of presentation provided in book is also very interesting and none of the part is boredom. I suggest you to read this book.
IF YOU READ THIS BOOK AFTER SEEING 3 IDIOTS WITH GREAT EXPECTATION THEN YOU ARE SURELY GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED. OTHER THAN THIS, THIS BOOK WILL ENTERTAIN WELL. YOU SHALL HAVE A SMILE AT LEAST FOR ONCE IN THREE PAGES. BUT THIS BOOK DOESNT HOLD ANY GOOD STORY LINE. IF YOU ARE BOREDOM THEN YOU CAN TRY THIS NOVEL TO SAY THE TRUTH THE NOVEL IS WRITTEN BY A EMINENT, EDITED BY PROFESSIONALS, ENDORSED BY SOME POPULAR PERSONALITIES THAT'S WHY IT GOT ITS FAME...NOTHING MUCH SPECIAL IN IT---
I ordered this book three days before and i recived it today . The book is good . Thumbs up to Chetan Bhagat . Starting and ending is also good . Middle part is awesome . A must read for all IITians and NonIITians .
This book is very cool which describes the college life in such a simple manner that even the students will get amused how beautifull the book is and how the chetan wrote this book, which makes the reader happy and will to read as many times as they can..i assure just go and get the book and flow down in the breeze of five point someone..Chetan you rocks.....
at first this book was doing all well but i think the clarity of the story was a bit dim.i myself being an iit aspirant,but the book quite got me on tenterhooks.the ragging thing got on my nerves and the gpa's,phew!but that was the 90's,so maybe i'm not judging right.but all the same,the story's nice and its quite funny too.so i take my leave by saying:"dont expect much from the book.i did and i finished it in 1 day straight.my first chetan bhagat book,so no offense.have to try the other books too.
This is the book which made me to think whether I can try to write anything. I have completed 3 books(Revolution 2020, 2 states and Five Point Someone) of Chetan Bhagat. I am trying to buy all the books. This is the first english Book, I spent my time to complete.
I read this book two years back. Though I liked the story, the setting and the narration, I felt like I was watching a film. Bhagat creates the same problems we find in films. Hero loves heroine and while the heroine's father is away, hero comes home and gets caught by the heroine' father. I did not like this. I feel that Bhagat should change this type of story telling.
Can I rate it lower than a star? Five Point One suffers from an identity crisis of sorts- Chetan Bhagat needs to figure out whether he's writing a so called mature book for 10 year olds or manure for adults. The book suffers from weak grammar and a non existent plot. The characters are as thin as a sheet of paper and there is nothing unpredictable. This is not the book that made the movie '3 Idiots'. This is just trash which is not expected from someone who's supposed to be an IIT gradate. The pathetically written romance and lack of substance are equally bad. If you are a sex hungry 15 year old with dung for brains, this is right up your alley. For others, please do not let Mr. Bhagat insult your intelligence. On an afterthought, the only readable thing present in the book was the social issue it raised. Kudos for that. Still, the poor writing dragged it down. Better luck next time, sir.
this book is very nice...i think it is the best book chethan bhagat has ever written. man it is an EXCELLENT,OUTSTANDING book.it contains tragedy,comedy everything.once you start reading you cant stop till it is completed
The novel is a master piece of chetan bhaghat i must say. the story is garnered with emotions,love,humor etc.. which is simply superb. as per the caption it's a must read for any students those who mugs their lessons.it is unbelievable that a person who does not have any writting background has written this and made it a best selling and adorable one. hats off chetan
Absolutely the top of the shelf. 3 Idiots, the movie based on the book, despite all the money it made, was not a patch on the book. Sincere, honest, witty and poignant at the same time, the boo will assure Chetan Bhagat a place in Indian literary history. read it if you have not done so already.
TIME PASS HAI BHAI , IF YOU TRAVELLING IN THE TRAIN IT WILL BE GOOD BOOK FOR TIME PASS. TIME PASS HAI BHAI , IF YOU TRAVELLING IN THE TRAIN IT WILL BE GOOD BOOK FOR TIME PASS. TIME PASS HAI BHAI , IF YOU TRAVELLING IN THE TRAIN IT WILL BE GOOD BOOK FOR TIME PASS. TIME PASS HAI BHAI , IF YOU TRAVELLING IN THE TRAIN IT WILL BE GOOD BOOK FOR TIME PASS.
I started reading this book at 10 PM...finished at 6 in morning...enjoyed a lot...Chetan's one of the best. I recommend everyone to read it...don't go by critics review..some people have habit of always criticizing the things...look at the majority...

It is so replete with mistakes (and sheer stupidity) that one can barely finish a quarter of the book. A non-existent plot, cheap and superficial characters, no conceivable common thread (except that the word IIT comes up every now and then). This book is a scathing indictment of his so-called education, and we can only hope, that this is not reflective of the rest of the IITians. If you get a choice between slow, painful death and this book, choose the former; at least your time will be well spent. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS.
its a great book one must read it.............. chetan bhagat just write awesome books awesome and awesome............... its a great seller book and written truly very good and fully awesome.....................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chetan made nice thoughts of Hari.Thanking Bill Gates and Microsoft corp in the preface,comparing Alok's spects as bullet proof ones,contratry of gym machine by Ryan and some dialouges of Hari are good and funny.But their conversations and imaginations using bad words,drinking vodka,scolding profs very badly are objectionable and may misled the youth.With such behavior of Ryan and Hari, no IITian can pass even a semister
I first read it a good six years ago and had loved it. I still like it. It is no literary masterpiece and it would be wrong to compare it with one. It is a dime novel and a good one. It offers a good, quick read - it is a page turner and keeps you hooked till the end. Good pieces of literature linger with you even when you have read the last word. This is not one of them. It does not leave any lingering impressions. You do feel a little good and warm when you reach the end. If you have to while away an afternoon or have a long commute or have to pass a long night or if you have watched the movie pick up this book - it won't disappoint; just don't expect to gain anything from it. This is the best piece by Mr. C and his writing has gone positively downhill with each subsequent work. If you do like it and decide on getting other of his novels I'd advice that you buy One Night @ Call Centre and then banish all thoughts of purchasing the rest.
This is an epochal book (and those who went to major engineering colleges will specially identify with the characters). However, it is the only worthwhile book Chetan Bhagat wrote. "Call centre" was just bearable (though the ending was rubbish) and "3 mistakes" was complete rubbish aimed at becoming a script for a third-rate masala movie. Let us see if he has regained his touch.
If you wish to take your english for a ride, this book is a must read. Those of you who still read 'champak' will love it to the core. And, as you know Mr. Chetan, the self professed youth icon, and a soon to be politician doesn't disappoint those looking for B-grade humour.
This book sucks to the core. Chetan Bhagat is no writer. He probably just intended to attract todays youth by using catchy vulgur phrases and four letter words. In any other country, it will be discarded.... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
it is a must read.. very entertaining one... read this one when i heard about the controversy of a great bollywood blockbuster 3 IDIOTS... but ya seems alot like the book.. they are very similar dialogue, almost the same dialogues.. but there are some minors changes though... about the book, a good entertainer.. i am a very slow reader, but i completed this in just 2 days, that is one of my record reads.. i rush through books for 2 reasons... 1. they must be boring, so i want to get out of it fast.. 2. they must so interesting, i cant resist reading it fast.. this book is definetely comes under the latter category.. joyful one.
Chetan Bhagat's best work so far. A light read, with good wit and humor. And an apt inspiration for THREE IDIOTS.
Chetan Bhagat's books are as cheap as they cost! the first-time-novel-readers may like all the filmy, no-brainer stories. i will be frank, even i felt entertained initially, that was when i had not read many other novels. once you step into the actual world of meaningful story-writing.... this will feel like crap. Mr. Chetan, if your life is truly what you have portrayed in these novels.... i would say go, get a life chum!! Third-rated.
the book is gr8........but the edition i got is a crap version ......in many places there is no print at all.Same thing happened with my Angels n demons............we trust flipkart and place orders ........just see to it n make sure ur customers get a good version of their order...............
