Introduction To Algorithms 3rd Edition@@@"Introduction to algorithms 3rd edition" is unarguably the best book for learning algorithms and data structures.The description for each topic is very lucid and you won't need any extra assistance to understand the contents.
I find this book very useful for studying algorithms. Language is good and easy to read. Concepts are very well explained. Only one problem i can think of is that the material is advanced. If you are just a beginner, you may not find it useful for the basic data structures (arrays, linked lists etc.). All in all, i think this book is a must have for everyone who is studying algorithms.
A great book but will be useful only if you already have knowledge about data structures. Topics are not explained in great detail. will not recommend it to people doing data structures for the first time. Flipkart's delivery was spot on.
The content of the book is just excellent.Everything is described beautifully..But the book is obviously not for beginners.
I felt this book may be a bit hard to start. But a great reading for an advanced reader. A must read for a programming lover.
Best book for algorithms...no other book even comes close to this one Language is easy and quality is great
I have visited this book back from time to time when I needed to find detailed analysis of certain categories of algorithm.
The book is very good, it provide in-depth knowledge on Algorithms design. However I would not recommend this book for beginners. This is more like reference book. Mathematical notation are good but sometime cryptic to read.
NO word to describe the book just blindly go for it..... Dont think much its worth of every penny u spent on it whatever the price may be coz its ur good companion dude
The book is very good. It explains each topic in a very lucid language and covers the basics very well. Also, the delivery by flipkart was on time and smooth which is very much satisfying. :)
its is an excellent book for beginners........must buy!!!! -easy language ... -good price -perfect for those who just started learning algorithms.....
flipkart did a good job , delivery before expected time , paper quality and packaging was ok. A little discrepancy in pages was there but within manageble parameters
As good as almost more than 100 pages are missing from the book. I have bought 2 books from Flipkart and none of them are good. Its going to be the old way for me to purchase books i.e. go to book store check it and buy it.
Fast & impressive service from flipkart and of course the book needs no review-----all time classic,-- covers majority of important topics in very well logical way...must use if you are serious for conceptual understanding of algorithms !!
A must read book for a software professional. The book takes you step by step explaining every aspect of algorithms.
The best book on Algo possible- for the beginners, the coders and the algo developers. BTech, Mtech. PhD- if u r in CSE or IT, u need it. always. Available at Flipkart at the lowest price possible.
Nice book!! Detailed explanation of each concept, also you need to think for implementing it in any language.
it is a book which covers a wide range of algorithmic problems and its analysis.It is also a great book of data structure.The explanations are so precise that anyone who have a little knowledge in programming, can grasp it quickly.You may need a little understanding on maths,and the book itself contains all the required mathematical concepts.All algorithms are written in C programming style, so you can easily implement it in your favorite programming language.One thing which I like mostly is that, for an algorithmic problem,it first discuss the brute force algorithm and then the efficient algorithms and also discuss the advantages (and disadvantages, if any) of the efficient algorithm over the brute force.This is a desirable skill of programmer analyst position.
This book is refered and suggested by pros in the industrie. Contains very neat explanation from basics.
this is the best book on algorithms that covers topics for noob and and also useful for a pro. best part is it gives all useful algorithms and analysis of these algorithms is very clearly explained.
Literally the bible of Algorithms .. A must read by all the novice to build the concepts in a very good manner.
It contains very perfect explanation of algorithms. In depth information of of a particular algorithm along with its processing capability is explained very nicely.
If you want to know and learn the basics of algorithm and data structure this is the best book to start with
Introduction to algorithms is a really nice book for students who want to delve deeper into the world of algorithms and at college it's considered a holy grail among freshman and sophomores.
newbees for data structure concepts can choose this book.. it is much worthier than any other books in data structures.. point blank
Its pretty good book.Delivery was on time.Excellent work guys ..Its really worth for every programmer.
Received the book under 3 days. Flipkart's Service is just brilliant. This book has everything u will need to know about Algorithms including Searching, Sorting and Data Structures.A must Buy for All Computer Science students. is useful in a variety of ways...Even in Placements and graduation ahead.
This is the best book you can have for Data structure and algorithms. (Sedgewick comes in at a close second)
Videos are also available on MIT. Search : MIT Introductions to algorithms. Videos are also available on MIT. Search : MIT Introductions to algorithms.
Great read, along with this I'd recommend the book by Adam Drozdek. Covers Theory nicely, the one by Drozdek is more easy to understand and provides implementation, but this book is great too
This is a superb book but should not be the first book for this subject to buy for a rookie. The course material meets the industry standards and includes the advanced topics mostly. If you are a computer science student you must go for it but first get your elementary topics cleared from the books like Data Structures with C and Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy.
A good book to cover the syllabus and get a little more insight of the algorithms. It covers a most of the topics like Graph Theory that are included in almost every college's syllabus.
It helped me during the semester exams. Good book and happens to help for understanding graph theory concepts as well as other algorithms. Buy, if you need to study the subject a little more than in your syllabus.
Excellent book. Received through flipkart within 3 days. Best book for beginners new to the subject. Includes in depth analysis of must-know algorithms and data structures. Must have book for computer science students
After request from Flipkart to "Please edit your review of Introduction to Algorithms 3 Edition" I am not going to remove my earlier experience & trouble I get. After following up I got the book replaced, now print quality is upto the mark for which I am satisfied. But again the quality of paper being used is not upto the mark. Hence I am keeping my earlier review as it is. Thanks, suman kumar Looking at reputation of flipkart I ordered Introduction to Algorithms 3 Edition. I received the book very fast & was excited to read that but after flapping few pages I found that book print quality was too bad - same content getting printed opposite side of page & thus other side content has become text garbled. This problem is across the book making it of no use to me.Hence I complained to replace the same. Also quality of paper being used is very bad, same on PHINDIA. If again I receive same quality of paper I am going to complain Author of the book who is world famous author for this topic. I will escalate to higher management of Flipkart as well as PHINDIA. Please mind is Sapna book store is very near to me anytime I can get this book with quality assured, same is expected from Flipkart as well. Thanks, suman kumar
This book is the sole book you need to be an expert in algorithms. It has great depth, and great breath. It makes it voluminous - but then you just need to read this book to be an expert. Easy to read also
this is an excellent book for beginners as well as experts! my professors prefer this book, i read some concepts from this book in library... but as a student i wanna short and exam oriented book, like my friends! after my graduation, i wish to complete it and so bought an ebook! It was really amazing, the concepts in this book are deep and clear...! Lovely book!!!
At first Thank you Flipkart to delivers this book in 2 days. 5 out of 5 for your service. Now, This book is a errorfree book and the good thing is that it explains the algorithm very smartly,so that any one can understand it.So must read it for learn algorithm.
Explained everything about the subject..highly recommended for engineering students..concepts are clearly given. Nice one for understanding the basics.My professor recommended this book for me.Lot of problems are given for evaluating your skills.
Book Delivery : I received the book 2 days ahead of the stipulated delivery date. So Kudos to Flipkart Delivery Services. The book was nicely packed, and obviously included a funny bookmark provided with all book purchases from flipkart. The current edition of the book costs Rs 995/- and has 1292 numbered pages + 20 roman indexed pages = 1312 pages. Every inch of this book is same as the previous edition, which costs around 525/-. I had ordered the current edition ( Rs. 995/- , which I bought for Rs. 451/- after a nice 54.% discount ). Unfortunately, I received the previous edition (Rs. 525/-). I contacted the customer care, and received the replacement within a week. The replacement was slightly damaged, but that was probably because of mishandling in their warehouse or something, nothing worth worrying though... So I am pretty satisfied here as well. Review : This book is the best algo book around. No complains about the content of the book. I have still not yet read a lot from this book, but this is the book recommended for my Algorithms paper (IT dept.). The book is totally worth every penny it costs ! Keep in mind that this book is very thick.. So don't freak out ! It of-course has a very mathematical approach, so it has tons of maths.. ( I really freaked out there :D ). All in all, the book is totally worth the purchase. It is a great book !
Best book available in the market for algorithms.It has got something for everyone.You might be beginner or professional,you will definitely learn something new from this book.I would highly recommend you to buy if you are a serious programmer. And as usual flipkart service simply superb.......Got my book in a day
Must read, if you are computer engineer or willing to be one of them. I didn't read much but still it's worth buying. By Computer Engineer, To Computer Engineer, From Computer Engineer. Flipkart shipment was awesome as always.
For a passionate Comp Sci Engineer, I don't know what I was doing all these years. I never bothered checking out this book from the College Library, all these wasted years! Why did my university prescribe any other book I don't understand. Warning 1: The math might be more intensive than necessary, I just skip through it. I don't need it. Warning 2: The book is not 100% comprehensive. Fast Flipkart delivery. They are saving in cost of packaging. Nothing wrong, saves trees.
I am 16 but I literally am mad about computers. It has extremely high level of math and is extremely hard to understand at my level (1 year of basic C++). But with enough research and going through algorithms 2-3 times I do manage to master them. This book is amazing. I can read it all day all night. The pseudocode can easily be converted to Java and C++ (I make programs in both). Original cost of this book is around 60-70 dollars but flipkart is selling it for like 375 rupees so I would really like to thank flipkart. Now if you are sure you will give the time and devotion required close your eyes and buy it. Its definitely the Bible.
I would not mention any thing about the product coz everyone knows this is a world famous publication and is taught worldwide. Only suggestion to user is to read this book in parallel with the video lectures on MIT website ( these are free lectures) This is gonna be a deadly combination :) this book will be a lot easier to learn with those video lecture . Thanks to flipkart for the timely delivery :)
This is the best book for understanding the concept of data structure and algorithms. Every computer science student should read this book. In this book each topic is explained very clearly. Thanks to the flipkart team for the delivery of this book before the excepted delivery date.
This book is simply the bible of algorithms. If you have ever been to the MIT OCW site and seen their video lectures, the book is exactly on the same lines as that of the lectures. A MUST KEEP BOOK FOR ALL COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERS!
I read 1st part of the book (as a beginner who knew almost (not totally) about algorithms). Here is what I felt * Great description of algorithms and analysis. * You will love the pseudo code * Good math skills are needed. Certain algorithms are just thrown at readers as exercises - Don't skip them * For self learners: Should take a year to complete (approx, might take more). You got to be patient to cover all areas - especially exercises. * As a text book? : Yeah! Follow your class lecturers, refer the topic in this book at home, get the exercises done, you are King! * This book talks about lots of topics which generally aren't covered in many books. That's why its difficult to understand, a big 1300 pgs. * IN BRIEF: (If you got good math, enough time and good tutor or guide, get this one)
Hello everybody, Actually I m from the It stream but i m a little weak in the area of data structures and algorithms.I came to know about this book through flipcart and the reviews about this book helped me to absorb the rough idea of this book. So i ordered this book and thanks to the Flipcart since they delivered the book within the stipulated time. I would say that its the bible for Data structures. the concepts have been explained well and in the high class manner. the real time examples have been quoted well and the concepts can be easily understood even for the beginners. So i would say that if u feel u r slow in Data structures, U go for this book "Intro to algorithms".... This book will turn u into the master of DS. Thanks to the flipcart team for the delivery of this book on the exact date.....
It is a "MUST BE READ" book for any computer science student to have in their personal library... You can master algorithms if you learn the concepts given in the book thoroughly.. Don't leave the exercises... Solve the exercise too... be a master of algorithms....
This book is anyways recommended in all algorithms classes, so barely something someone like me needs to reviews, must read for everyone having the algo course. But happen to be thick so buy if you intend to read it all, and not just because someone said so.
This is a all bible book for learning algorithms. This book is for people who are profs and can understand better. For students it is not that useful as it is hard to understand. Better if you look for other books on this subject if you are a student.
This book provides excellent and extensive coverage on the topic of Algorithms, and is a must-have in the shelf of every CS student and programmer. The scope of this book and the depth at which each topic is covered is astounding; yet remaining perfectly readable. As an icing on the cake, the price is surprisingly low for such a large (1200+ pages) book.
Don't think more, anybody wanting to learn algos in and out need this book. The title is a bit misleading. Its not just an introduction but a very detailed analysis of the most common problems and algorithms.
I found it very much exciting to build the concepts in algorithms from the scratch. Although some mathematical background is require but that too is available in the appendix separately....thanx flipkart for amazing services!
Quite fat book it is. I'll have to admit whether I'll ever read the book in its entirety. Bought the book upon others' reviews/suggestions. Good addition to my book shelf anyway. Flipkart packing excellent, as usual!
This is a all time hits book for laerning algo....u can buy this book closing your eyes...the price given for this book is much lesser than what u get in this book ....also superfast delivery by flipcart
An understanding of the contents of this book is sure to make you a better algorithm designer and programmer. Don't buy this book if you think it'll make better overnight. It can be quite hard for beginners to understand.
Well written and composed book for every category of readers. With adequate amount of mathematical background provided wherever needed. No wonder, people call it bible of Algorithms. One word for the book, awesome! Ans yes, Flipkart services as always, awesome!
This is a great book for computer science students. This book helps to understand algorithm and complexity of the algorithm as well. This book is helpful in building general idea before writing any algorithm. Various advanced algorithms are covered in this book. Content of the book is really nice for e.g. growth of functions, greedy algorithms, red black and minimum spanning trees, amortized analysis, graph algorithms, median and order statistics etc.
This is the best book for any computer programmer. I have been writing computer software codes and patches for a long time now and I'm always in search of doing things faster and easily. Which is only possible if you are good at algorithms, which this book is excellent at. It would help you learn how to write algorithms and make your task faster and simpler. It is a must buy for any computer science or mathematics student. Also it is from a great publisher- MIT itself. The price of the original US edition is around 2700 INR but I got it in just 276 INR (of course its a LPE edition), which is great in itself. And for Flipkart, best service as always !
Though some chapters are hard, this book makes it very simple, easy to read with lots of pseudo-code examples. Perfect text book for anyone who wants to study algorithms. There are problems at the end, solve them for exam questions
this book was deliverd to me in time, thanks to flipkart....... book is very good........all the content is very well organised.. so i think this is a best buy for all comp guys...............................................................................
This is best book for student and professional who are interested in Computer Science in aspect of Maths. This book covering the full spectrum of modern algorithms. This book covers all the mathematical aspect of computer science. Maths and Algorithm is closely related, we can say that algorithm is nothing but one type of mathematics. After reading you can realize this. This book is also used by many universities worldwide. This is âBible of Algorithmâ
I HAVE HAVE ABOUT THIS BOOK FROM MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY FROM THOSE WHO CONSTITUTE HIRING TEAM AT GOOGLE,MS AND OTHER BIG BRANDS ESPECIALLY IN U.S.A SO I THOUGHT THE BOOK WILL BE WORTH A TRY AND I PURCHASED IT.I CAN'T SAY WHETHER THE BOOK IS BETTER OR BEST BECAUSE I HAVE HARDLY USED IT,I THINK FOR AN INDIAN STUDNT WHO IS IN THE PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT HE SHOULD USE ANY OTHER BOOK ALSO FOR UNDERSTANDING THOSE EASY CONCEPTS ALSO BUT THIS BOOK HAS TAKEN FORGRANTED THAT YOU KNOW IT,OUR SYLLABUS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL IS DESCRIPTIVE TYPE AND NOT RESEARCH ORIENTED WHICH ALSO GOES AGAINST THIS BOOK,BUT IF YOU ARE GOING FOR ADVANCED DEGREE OR ANY NATIONAL LEVEL EXAM THEM THIS BOOK IS WORTH SHORT.BUT I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD USE IT FOR UNIVERSITY EXAM,NOW IT DEPENDS ON YOU TO CHOOSE
If you want to be good at programming, you have to get the basics right. This book is a must read for programmers to write efficient programs and to know how to evaluate their own algorithms performance.
If u want to do PhD......read "The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth" :-) else read Cormen and do some nice programming...
This is a best algorithm book to read for all engineering students , very interesting.But don't buy if you don't have strong command over engineering mathematics. This book is in official curriculum for MIT technology students so it requires whole lot of brain workout. Although book is quite understandable. Thank you Flipkart for making this kind of stuff available.
Collection of all the Important and most widely used algorithms. Good Book for all the Big Job Hunters, the Examples in here could've been more simple. This book is a collection of algorithms, and Flipkart's delivery's just awesome.. On or Before DOT.
This is a complete book (for undergraduate level), like a bible for algorithms. With page number running into four digits, it's a very detailed and descriptive book, which makes it an excellent learning resource for beginners. A good grip of mathematics will be of great help. However, most of what is required is put into the Appendix, so you won't have to go hunting for a piece of maths. This is a great book, which is further solidified by the fact that it is used as a textbook for MIT (Massachusetts, USA) Undergraduate Course 'Introduction to Algorithms'.

a very beautiful, comprehensive book. a must for every computer science student. and btw thanks to flipkart, gr8 service.. received package less than 24 hrs.. :D .. looking forward for more titles ahead ..:D
Its a awesome book. It need to crack gate and also semester exam.
One of the best book for beginners. I was most impressed by FlipKart's delivery package; wrapped nicely & a free bookmark ;)
Great book and great shipping service..covers a vast area of algorithm design techniques..
thanks to flipkart for their extremely good service,the book delivered is new.Most importantly I missed to take delivery yesterday and called 'em up at 2 a.m, told 'em preferable time to deliver. today morning at my preferred time i'v got the book.
This book is lifetime resource for me. When a great quality book is accompanied with 40% dicount super excellent Flipkart service....nothing more is demanded...
its illustration is good,as well as d eg's.you must have this book for knowledge n syllabus.. a book in your self for lyf tym.. so dont wait n go 4 it. its d cheapest in bangalore.
I had ordered this book on July 21st 2011 around 12:45pm. And received a brand new copy in excellent condition a few minutes ago i.e., July 22nd 2011 around 12:30pm. Less than 24 hours. Thanks Flipkart, for your excellent service and prompt delivery!
This book is a very very good book, I recommend it to everyone who has interest in algos. Flipkart had a very good turnaround, I received the book within two days.
First of all, thanks to flipkart for selling this bible for such a low price. The title is self-explanatory for this review. This is a well known book all around the world. Just call it CLRS people will know
I bought the book mainly coz i'm studyin my 1st yr CSE and i though i feel it might be of use. It seems pretty cheap price for such a think book and its filled with useful algorithms. My brother whu finished his comp.sci. degree took a look at it and said that half of what he learnt is in the book and the rest is extra to what he learnt My judgement: Its definitely a must buy if ur in the IT side, or hav interest in it :)
All people, ranging from beginners to experts can gain a lot from this book. It's a well written book which uses a structured flow for explanations that allows one to grasp and retain concepts efficiently. A "must buy" book for Algorithms.
This is a must buy book for Computer Science students/professionals
Having read many books on Algorithms, this one definitely deserves a special place. I would not be flattering if I can say that this is the bible of Algorithms. Folks, if you are trying to learn Algo's and land up in niche place, this is the book you should refer. Last not the least, thank you flipkart for giving 40% off on such a wonderful book
Anyone who wants to buy this book, are you in skeptic mood? The best thing I can say about this book is If you are an expert-> you will be happy to remain an expert and become stronger intermediate->expert beginner->you will be so happy to write a review as a new person :)
Algorithms, which perform some sequence of mathematical operations, form the core of computer programming. Intended as a text for computer programming courses, especially undergraduate courses in data structures and graduate courses in algorithms, an “Introduction to Algorithms” provides
