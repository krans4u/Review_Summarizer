CHANAKYAS CHANT ( NEW EDx@@@I caught a glimpse of this book while browsing through Bestsellers section of Flipkart. I had come across Chanakya before in my history books as the mastermind behind Chandragupta's ascent to the throne of Magadha but I had never read an account of his exploits. So I ordered this book and Flipkart with its customary excellence delivered it without any hint of delay. And it turned out to be an exceptional read which alternates between the past and the present scenario of Indian politics as both Chanakya and Gangasagar compete in the display of their conniving brains. Really Ashwin Sanghi deserves great appreciation for creating such racy & wonderfully researched fiction out of historical facts. I recommend this book to all the lovers of politics and others also could try it out to get a peek into the all-encompassing world of politics. I assure you will like this page-turner. I have already placed my order of the "Krishna Key", the third novel by Ashwin Sanghi. Eagerly waiting for its arrival and hopeful that it will stand out to my expectations.
Well researched , good creativity , good style of writing , good depth etc. But I personally think that it should have been divided in 2 sections, one about Chanakya and one about gangasagar. Instead it bounces from history to present.Well, some may find it interesting but I found it a bit confusing.When I completed one chapter, I wanted to read the same story, but it shifted to another story.And soon started confusion...specially in the gangasagar story. I forgot characters and their plans. Overall its a good read. One must read it. I recommend it.
I started reading this book following the immense popularity that this book enjoys on flipkart and found myself frustrated! Its all just conversation and no narration. Shallow story telling.. Scene's so small you can't even make out what's happening.. The author has immense grip on the historical facts but he fails to link them in a manner to engross the reader. I was thoroughly disappointed after reading this book since the book is far below expectation!
the portion of the chanakya is fantastic and really very good. The author has worked very hard in research of the history and the efforts are quire appreciable. Only the current era portion was somewhat boring due to the political quotas of gangasagar mishra but in spite of that the pace was really good.. A good to read and nice couple of one liners at the very end of the novel......
It is a remarkable book indeed and the author has written so gracefully that you feel transformed to the world he has weaved inside this brilliant book. Worth a Buy!
This book will take you for a complete political thriller journey inspired by the thinking of chanakya. It also explores the life of Chanakya and compares it with present situation in a very good manner. Really interesting, you'll love it. After reading this one you will surely like to read other books by Ashwin Sanghi. He is unique with great sense of making you stick to his stories.
Not a book to be missed, not giving it 5 out of 5 just because market is flooded with better books, but that makes it no less, MUST READ, you Can't stop once u start. Get set go.
I am a big fan of Ashwin Sanghi, and I must say that his first book - " The Rozabal line" is my most favourite book of all time. With that expectation, i bought this book, and frankly it dint live up to the expectations, may be because the expectation was set too high. The book starts really good, very well paced, and exceptional shifting of two different eras chosen wisely. However, towards the end, it seems that the author was in a hurry to finish the book when the years slipped by unnoticed in both stories. There was a point when i even thought that i had kept the bookmark wrongly. First the cons 1. Too fast paced in the second half. 2. No references are given to the historical facts ( unlike his exceptional first book ). 3. We never know what is true and what is purely fictional. Pros 1. Made a good reading, with excellent clarity of thoughts. 2. I loved the simultaneous progress of two eras. Very interesting read.
This is one of the books that has been most influential to me. I have learnt so much from it. Brilliant narration. Cant stop it once you start.
I seriously have no words to describe the awesomeness of this book. Hats off to the author...Keep it Up!!
What can I say except for the fact the novel is simply awesome. Its one of the great Indian novels that I have read in a long time. The story goes on smoothly and is quite interesting. The political strategies used in this novel are greatly conceptualized and it can work wonders if someone actually implements them in today's scenario. I m giving it 4 stars because 5 stars are very hard to come from me.
The way the author has woven the past and the present scenarios in a dramatic manner is amazing. Enjoyed my read..Thanks!
Reminiscent of masala bollywood movie with no story to tell. Predictable and boring. Would not recommend.
Nice way to depict Chankya's life in parallel with present day politics. Arthashastra depends on Rajneeti, both can't be segregated.
Such a powerful read. This is my first book from Ashwin Sanghi's collection and it has been an amazing read. The storytelling gripped me throughout the time. I've delayed few other works to take out time for me to finish it and I don't regret it. Chanakya's Chant sail between two different eras bringing you the dirtiest, informative and amusing story.
I hardly read fiction but somehow got hold of this book on flipkart. The service of flipkart should not be questioned as i am regular buyer. They are as usual brilliant. About the book, it is full with thrill and smart lines. It gives a deep understanding of how political system works in India and the comparisons and chapters on Chankya are enlightening. The author has made this book an interesting read with good and balance amount of wit n humour though not missing the link and serious content. I liked the characterization of Gangadhar Mishra. I will recommend this book to readers who are keen to understand what happened 2300 yrs ago and how it is still applicable and that too with same intensity. The research is very good.
Nice to read the book is a depiction of old chanakya in the new current world, Ashwin Sanghi's uncanny ability to keep you turning the pages is his strongest skill. I had loved The Rozabal Line but in that Sanghi had allowed the pace to slacken in the second half. In this book, the story hurls you through Magadha, 2300 years ago, and from there to New Delhi in the present day
a thrilling historical facts with an amazing creation by the author ashwin sanghi........JUST MIND BLOWING NEVER HEARD A THRILLING HISTORICAL STORY LIKE THIS NEVER BEFORE......
IT IS MY SECOND NOVEL AFTER I RODE THE TWO STATES OF CHETAN BHAGAT.. I WAS THEN EAGERLY SEARCHING FOR THE NEXT ONE WHICH WOULD BE AS GRRIPING AS MY FIRST ONE WAS...AND GOT STUCK WITH THIS BOOK WHICH DEALS WITH TWO DISTINCT ERAS OF TIME... I WAS ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT THE CHANAKYA'S WISDOM AFTER I HAD SAW THE SERIAL OF CHANDRAGUPTA MAURYA THE ONE TELECASTED ON IMAGINE TV BUT ITS SUDDEN END MAKES MY CURIOUSITY UNSOLVED ,SO I FINALLY DECIDED TO READ THIS NOVEL AND GUESS WHAT...! THIS WAS MORE EXCITING AND THRILLING THEN THE PREVIOUS ONE...ASHWINI HAS MADE THAT KNOWLEDGE RELEVANT TO THE PRESENT WORLD TOO...WHICH IS AWESOME... I AM ASSURING ALL THE VIEWERS THAT THIS BOOK WILL MAKE U KEEP ON TURNING PAGES UNRELENTLESSLY.. I WANT TO THANK ASHWINI SANGHI AT LAST THAT HIS NOVEL CHANKYA'S CHANT HAS MADE ME MORE THRUSTY ABOUT READING NOVELS...
Chanakya's Chant is one of the fastest reads that I've had in a very long time. I have completed book in 72 hrs time during last weekend. Ashwin Sanghi's uncanny ability to keep you turning the pages is his strongest skill. I had loved It takes you to Magadha, 2300 years ago, and from there to New Delhi in the present day. It's a roller-coaster ride with murder, intrigue, political drama, espionage, and lust thrown in at just the appropriate times to prevent one from putting down the novel. "Brilliant" is the only word that can describe this thriller!
Very Interesting book. Know the real game behind Indian politics in current scenario also. Also story of the legend Chanakya. A book which makes us think and entertain at same time..
The book compare the historical personality Chankya and with living one of this modern era. I learned few about politics, cant stop reading before it ends.
This was my first ever book. And its bang on. I got so much addicted to it now I read it everyday. It starts with Chanakya's beginnings with Takshashila university and auther smartly take u back again to present Patna with a different story. But I feel the 2nd story should not have been there. I wanted everything to read on Chanakya, but this book is not covering everything, but a quick story I would say. Really additive book I must say. Author written very cleaver present day stories alongside the Chanakya path.
Read completely in one breath..Must Read and u may get jitters along the journey of this book.kudos to the research team .
If you want to look politics from a different point of view, history from the skies or understand today's politics or business deals, go ahead with this book. when i started this book i thought it to be a mere history reciting book, but was completely amazed by the plot and strategy.
What a book !!! While the first book , 'The Rozabal Line', was quite dissapointing for me, but this book made up for it ! What a awesome story the author has written and just how magnificently he has stringed together the story of past and present !!! I really couldn't keep this book down after I started it !! A MUST MUST READ !!!
Dirty Politics, how bad politics can be played by any person.... !!! Ultimate Story.... I brought this book only by its title... but found it really interesting.... Kept my interest bound till the very last page and completed it late night... one of the very fast read by me after long....
The mixing of history with present case is extremely good, it is like reading two stories at a time. Political strategies are well described and most of them seems illegal but practical and serves the purpose for good.
I bought Chanakya's Chant on an impulse, being an avid fan of Chanakya's philosophy. The book turned out to be one of the best I've ever read recently. It builds strong parallels between the Magadha of 2300 years ago, and present day New Delhi. Filled with all the essential elements of espionage, murder, intrigue, and political drama, it also makes readers long for one such charismatic political leader, the country desperately needs!! Definitely an 'unputdownable' book.
When u read about our history than you have lot of other extra knowledge which we don't want to read this is the book where you can read all the important events and step what chanakya take at there life. with very interesting current world chanakya's story. a full of suspense and with lot of mind food. a roller coaster story,.. must read
If only all our politicians today could read this book. For a moment while reading, I was tempted to become a part of the political world and bring in changes just the way mentioned in the book. Have gone ahead to gift this book to a few of my friends and each one of them have appreciated the book. The book is just a must-read!
Its rare that you come across books that you want to revisit, even before you have completed once. And even rarer, that you actually end up reading it twice. Chanakya's Chant is one such rare exponent of perfection in writing. An amazing blend of two voraciously written plots, it flawlessly integrates the diametrically opposite ages into a theme. Blockbuster read. Must be in every bookshelf.
Chanakya's Chant , is one of the best books one could ever have in their collection. I would recommend this to everyone. No second thoughts about it. This is not my first book from flipkart. I am happy with their services.
The narration is good from starting till ending. Connecting Chanakya's story with modern politics is very nice. Somethings we can predicted whats going to happen as we would have seen this kind of things many places.. overall its a nice read
Good read in terms of knowing the style of a comparatively new writer.. Chanakya's part is more of smooth literature artwork full with manipulations, where Panditji's part is more like showcasing fictional naked and vulnerable side of modern politics.. Overall, a good read !!
A one time but good to to read book. Maniacs like me may collect for personal collection......................................................
Chanakya's Chant is absolutely different from his previous novel, The Rozabal Line... If you read his previous novel and open this one with the same expectations, sorry to say, you will be fooled. No connection with the other novels.... Again, Flipkart service is wonderful and amazing.
Here the story of Chanakya has been narrated, as taken from the 1991 Doordarshan shw on Chanakya. Book is classic but more focus on story rather than principles of life
the best of Sanghi...impressive.....informative.........compelling...darkly humuored...its a well researched book..the highlight is dat the author doesnt tire d reader with too much details n complexities like in his other novels..... i wud say.. jusgo for it.. u wont lose...........
This beaks deals with comparison of a fictitious story alongwith that of Chanakya's Arthashastra.. Very Good book, and detailed experience of Chanakya in a very lucid and legible way.
This book is a classic in the making. Ashwin Sanghi's language, his political prowess, his understanding of the Cunning, I am surprised he isnt in a position of such power himself. . :) The book constantly goes back and forth in time and co-relates the era of Chanakya with our present day India. The first time I have enjoyed a political saga. .
Good thriller Good mixing of past & present Gives a good picture of our nation's DIRTY POLITICS., and what controls everything in our system
It may be only for people who understand constitution very well.It looses it's grip at the last 150 pages but ending is awesome.
Could not stop reading once I started!! This book truly deserves to be a bestseller. As for Flipkart, delivery was fast and the packaging was excellent. Completely satisfied.
A mixture of Indian history and present day politics. The book depicts about Chanakya, who with his politics made Chandragupta the king of undivided India. Present day the roles are being portrayed on Pandit Gangasagar and Chandni respectively. The author presented the two tales nicely but it may be confusing for few readers as the two tales run alternatively. Little immaturity in writing here and there but overall a decent read, will definitely keep you thrilled. A perfect material for Bollywood.
The book depicts two story lines in parallel and in both of the story everything happened so smoothly without having any trouble or disturbance. Whatever they have planned (both Chanakya and Gangasagar), executed in the right way as if there is no attempt from their rival to protect themselves. Politics is not so simple and in this regard I think the book lacks maturity. However, the stories have good pace and is of nice reading altogether.
Ashwin Sanghi's "Chanakya's Chant" is a great book. First of all considering the negative sides, this book can be a bit hard to catch up as two different stories of different ages are written together. But its wonderful to know that both stories are let to the same conclusion! However this book always strives as it has a modern narrative style with good vocabulary. I believe that it is a must read for all the people who are interested in politics, economics and business. Its actually worth buying it. If you are pensive or sad go and get this book and guess what you will gain? his book can really lift up your pleasure...
Intelligently written and yes the story building is good. Skillful and creative. Thumbs up !!! I am going to wait for something like Chanakya Chant in the future as the bar has been raised for the author ..
you have many expectation, reading the title. Don't judge a book by its cover. A Total disappointment... The plot is like of a Hindi movie of 90s.. its too predictable... and sometimes the transition between the present and the past is so abrupt, you are left with the question, "Y u no tell me now ?" don't waste your time on this, ask a friend who has read the book for the story...
'Chanakya's Chant' is a fast paced riveting piece blending the stories of two protagonists from two different era's - Chanakya (340 BC) & Pandit Gangasagar Mishra (Current). Its a well known fact how Chanakya – the strategist scripted the Chandragupta’s rise of power from rags and made him the ruler of undivided India. Burdened with his father’s murder, Chanakya sets out to take a revenge and end the melancholy that haunts him every now and then. He selects Chandragupta as the 'chosen one' and trains him at Takshila to impart and equip him with skills and wisdom of war and politics. His saga of revenge spans through years which witness him unifying the whole of India and thwarting various attempts by foreign invaders (specially Alexander) to usurp the Indian kingdom. The book takes precedence from Chanakya’s story of evolving Chandragupta from nowhere to a great warrior & an efficient ruler. History repeats itself after what it seems like ages when Pandit Gangasagar Mishra accidently stumbles upon a cursed chant written by The Chanakya. Taking recourse from the strategist himself, he sets on a journey to follow the footsteps of his idol and create a game of twists & turns; trust & deceit and diplomacy & manipulations to make his chosen one as the ruler (read Prime Minister) of India. The author Ashwin Sanghi, quite brilliantly, blends two stories from different eras to churn out a melodramatic package that has all (well..almost) the ingredients of making it a good read - wit, humor, conceit, deceit, treachery, jealousy and all other epithets associated with polity. Though, the basic soul of both the stories remain the same, the characters & treatment thereof, is something, that distinct them both. Full marks to the author for doing in dept research about the subject before resorting to create the aura of Chanakya’s ideology in current period. The story is very fast paced and with two stories of different era running simultaneously, it really binds the reader’s attention to the last page not leaving any scope of lousiness. On the flip side, the climax of the novel is somewhat predictable and doesn't leave a lot to reader's imagination. Also, the fact that only two persons viz. Chanakya & Pandit Mishra are the sole heroes of the story, all other being just secondary to them (including the great Chandragupta & his modern India counterpart Chandani) might just not go too well with some of the readers. Also, with so many twists (though riveting) in the plot & sub plots, the characters might confuse the reader a bit but it all falls in right place at the end.
The novel is very dark, not for everyone. Story runs parallel in two era's, one in Ancient India and the other in Modern day India. The author connects Chankya and Gangasar very well. An interesting read nonetheless !
The book is not as bad as presented by Shreyas, Zubair and Banerjee ji. And, I agree you have to be focused to read the book. The writing is good. I am happy that you seldom find any grammatical mistakes and a well researched book. I give it a thumbs up !!! Go for it, any day better than those written by the likes of durjoy datta & ravinder singh... It's more of a political fiction, so it also depends on one's preferences for reading. A mills and boons lover would not like it. and quite strategic book.
Dodging two different areas this book places too many characters at one place. Untill you go full concentration, easy confusion is on the cards. Politics is rampant in the narrative which can confuse and even bore the casual reader. choose it wisely as its much heavy interpreting this one.
I don't think i need to mention much about Flipkart's excellent delivery! So i'll get straight to the point....Chanakya's chant, according to me is the best among the books written by Ashwin Sanghi. The other two books written by this author borrow heavily ( and seriously HEAVILY) from Dan Brown's work. Chanakya's chant is a must read book that will entertain you and amplify your love for conspiracies. The switch b/w Past and Present makes it even more interesting. So if you like conspiracies, buy this with your eyes closed.
great service, received the order in time. The book is a thrillinbg combo of both myth and fiction and has been written very well by Ashwin. A must read for all politicians for it might add some rationality to the way they try and rule.
I heard a lot about this book, mostly positive reviews, and hence decided to give it a try. The story follows two timelines: one of 326 BC , depicting Chanakya, and the other, present day, featuring Gangasagar Mishra, the modern-day equivalent of Chanakya. I must say that the historical depiction of India is much better than the modern day one. The endeavors of Pandit Mishra do not seem realistic at all. The book can be made into a tolerable Masala movie, but its literary value, at least for the present day timeline, is nill. But Flipkart delivered the book as promised, and hence, kudos to them.
This was my second read from Ashwin Sanghi( first was krishna keys by the way by which I was terribly unimpressed).. But this one was different. Two stories ran parallel to each other. One would want to have basic knowledge in politics to enjoy this one though. The story starts off very well and fast paced but just stops in the middle and drags on for a part but again is a page turner towards the end. But the reader would definitely be impressed by the wittiness and presence of mind of the writer. politics and strategies involved. I would give it a pick and one time read. Nice work Ashwin
When I first looked at the title, I thought it is going to be yet another book on Chanakya and his arthashashtra. I just gave it a light preview reading and got myself glued to it. A spectacularly brilliant and awesome climax. Ashwin Sanghi knows how to capture a reader's attention. His writing is interesting and page turning. Simple, efficient language usage. Sanghi has done a lot of research has been done in writing this book (he gives acknowledgements at the back pages). I will definitely recommend this book to all.
this guy must have been one heck of an incarnation. it was an absolute delight reading this one, though the pace dropped occassionally...it picks up jus at the right time and keeps you engaged...i completed it in jus a couple of workin days and i thoroughly enjoyed it. hatsoff to the authour and thank u flipkart !!!!
Good things first: U get a glimpse of history from the chanakya's part of the book. Cons: Writing style: Poor Quotes: Daily quotes picked from Facebook/Twitter which are very common. English: Poor. Looks like a novel originally written in Hindi and then translated in English by poor translators. Plot: Fast paced but Known, nothing new. Verdict: Don't go for it. Pick something else instead.
excellent pace of the book.shrewd intelligent adaptation of chanakya into modern world indian politics.gives an insight in to many scandals and there perspective.must read for shrewd insight in to the dirty bad word called politics
I finished reading this book just an hour ago and I still cannot get out of the SPELL it has over me..!! I mean this book is just WOW! One of the best book I've ever come across in my life and I am really grateful for flipkart for recommending it to me. If it wasn't for flipkart, I would have missed this fantastic and awesome book. Ashwin Sanghi, if you are reading this sir, I bow down to you! Brilliant writing! The way this book unfolds itself with each page is the best part. The thing which made me click on the "Buy Now" button for this book was Chanakya. I have always been interested in this man's personality, his way of thinking and above all his political and strategical planning. I would like to quote blog INDIA reads here -: "It is much akin to reading a blow by blow account of Indian politics today. Of course as Chanakya’s story so aptly shows, it is not very different from Indian politics 2500 years ago either. So really the scams, scandals, corruption, collateral damage, war mongering, innocent deaths, communal riots – all the ills that we accuse the modern day politicians of -are nothing new. Nor is their use for gaining power a particular characteristic of our “depraved” leaders." If you are interested in reading books other than those cheesy teen stuff :P , then this is the book for you. Buy it now, and you have my word, you won't regret it! Enjoy reading this fabulous,mind boggling,witty,mythological and a tale of political thriller. Chanakya's magic worked over me, hope it will work over you too!! :D
This is not the cult hit or per se classic as other books in this list but yes, its definitely one time read for those who wish to peep into the razor sharp mind of Chanakya. The book holds 2 parallel stories, one about the plot by Chanakya to make one united Bharata and the other is of Pandit Ganga Sagar Mishra, who by profession is a Brahmin teacher but by instinct is just as sharp as Chanakya and lies with him the responsibility to make his lady protagonist a PM of India If handled properly, this book can be a good Bollywood movie plot like Rajneeti. But unfortunately, the author does not have the capability of linking the chapters properly, as Dan Brown does with Historical thrillers...and mind you, people are comparing Ashwin Sanghi with Dan Brown...not even remotely comparable...anyways but a good start for new generation Indian Writers even by handful of research on Internet has yielded good book... 3.5 star and good one time read....would love to watch a Bollywood movie from it
A realistic novel by Ashwin Sanghi. I couldn't keep this book away since I received it. A fine comparative style of Sanghi keeps you guessing about the moves and tactics of the masters of both the ages, Chanakya and Gangasagar Mishra. Most important aspect about this literature is that all the incidences about the contemporary Society and politics are absolutely realistic and wholly acceptable. Nowhere you feel the incidences are illogical or filmy. I would like to thank Ashwin mainly because he wrote about Chanakya, who is not much known to our generation and even because he included the fact that Alexander (I won't consider him GREAT) faced a failure in India. I hope our country finds its Gangasagar Mishra soon. Thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery.
A must read for those who are interested in Fiction and Indian Mythology related to Chanakya... This book easily summarizes events took place in ancient times and the mix with present is truely amazing as in other Amrish Books....
I am a bibliophile having read many books in English from classics to modern fiction and am still reading. I was also a history student and was fascinated by Chanakya's treatise on statecraft. Per se Mr. Ashwin Sanghi had done a good job on Chanakya creating a protogonist almost equal to him in modern day politics. But the book would have been more interesting had there not been any expletives, profanities and four letter words liberally/unnecessarily and out of context used by the author. At times I felt that American fiction was far better on this score. At least the authors do not take unnecessary liberty with the language used by them.This is definitely a put back for people like me to buy the other titles of the Mr. Ashwin Sanghi.
Ashwin is like the Dan Brown of India. Always looking for unusual in usual things. Chanakya always fascinated me and that was the only reason i bought this book. As far as the content is concerned, it is just average. But i really appreciate the venture of Mr. Sanghi. At least he gave us many thoughts. Hats off.
becomes very predictable for those who know the history well enough. and amateurish writing, and boring narration, read it for the sake of reading it, could not keep me hooked up even for 10 pages or so
2 parallel stories of the real chanakya and the modern day chanakya of Indian politics.Too many characters and I found it tough remembering who's who.Most importantly both the chanakyas always win by some way or the other and no opponent can match their wit and skill.I have a serious problem with this kind of win-win stories.Only plus point is that you get to know a lot about the real Chanakya though I do not know how much information is correct and how much is made up.
Author takes up the story of Chanakya and tries to place it in the modern India. And that's the only thing interesting here. The book is badly written with very bland prose. Developing characters is zealously avoided by author and we get very unidimensional characters. Protagonist Gangasagar comes across as a scheming and shady character whose only agenda is to make his protege PM of India by employing every dirty trick in book including murder of innocents, blackmail, bribery, mms videos etc. And the supposed purpose is to clean politics and strengthen the nation. But it doesn't do a good job of justifying it even with the maxim 'ends justifies the means' The schemes of supposed master tactician Gangasagar are too naive and convenient and assumes everyone except him is idiot. Even after the end of novel we are left wondering to the motives and motivations of main characters. The parallel track of historical Chanakya is only marginally better and that too because author had rich material of historical fact and myths to choose from. But here also author has gone mostly for myths and has made the story as far away from actual history as possible by going for most titillating myths and spicing them up to suit his story. Of course writers of historical fiction has the license to give their interpretations and add details but here the author overdo it. All in all a waste of time
A good one time read for sure. I liked the way the author keeps alternating between the Present and the Past (Chanakya's time). Politics is Dirty indeed :-) but very well described and worded by the author.
totally glued to it, awesome book. A must buy for thriller loving. The story starts with the sworning in of 18th PM of India and rolls back to the past and back to the present. The best character and the protagonist Gangasagar Mishra is alike Chankya.
This book will really keep you glued to it till the last page.Ashwin Sanghi's style of writing is awesome and he has well-knitted both modern plot and ancient plot. I would strongly recommend this book!!! Thanks to flipkart once again for the timely delivery.
I had high hopes with this book after reading positive reviews and seemingly interesting theme, but when i read the whole book, i found it contains two books, one is chanakya's real story that is really engrossing and an interesting read but here writer's contribution is little as it is real history and has already been written in countless novels and we have seen on television, the second book which is fictional and written by aswin sanghi has no msg, Gangadhar Pandit's only moto is to make chandini (god knws why spelling of her name is CHANDINI, instead of CHANDANI)prime minister of India, there is no higher reason or any thought about betterment of indian population, all SAAM, DAAM, DAND , BHED are used to achieve this filmsy goal including killing of chandini's real lover. This is horrible, plz skip it, i have given 2 stars just because of chanakya's story, without that zero would be appropriate.
Author has written a marvel doing justice to the intellect & enigma of Chanakya. Though in the second half of the book the pace slows down and the climax of both the stories seems to be hurried and a bit of an anti-climax, the fierce pace and thick plot from the beginning and the there-on soars your expectation. Nevertheless I loved this book and feel it is an awesome 1 time read, and the one which you would like to keep in your ensemble and get tempted to refer back for some wisdom quotes!
I felt that the book was written without any flavor and failed to indulge me into it and make me relate to any character. Instead it reads more like a forced set of events that take place. Sill an interesting concept...
In the Age of bolly masala flicks no doubt these books tops best seller lists. this is never rewarding nor keeps you intrigued because the author has nothing deep to offer. He had laid everything on the table and reader can swallow it without much effort .. Nb : read any Cine magazine in the meantime
The book is not as great as some reviews are trying to make it out to be. Whereas the original Chanakya's story is quite gripping and very well told, its the modern Chanakya's story that is not great. Apart from the modern adversaries looking to be dumb and modern Chanakya somehow has a pill for everything, the original Chanakya's story looks more plausible. But this is smaller of the issues. The bigger one is motivation. The original Chanakya was clearly driven by the bigger idea of unified Bharat and being kingmaker was just a tool for the same, the modern Chanakya is just happy to be a Kingmaker, but does not seem to have a bigger goal, either for himself or his protege or the country. The modern Chanakya, Gangasagar Misra, uses and abuses the same system that he is part of without any hint of him wanting to change it. And perhaps for the same reason, the original Chanakya and his well known story still outshines the unknown story of Gangasagar Misra.
I don't know why this book is so famous.. it's one of the most boring book i have ever read. Except Chanakya no other character is engaging. Its like one of the bollywood movies where only one character does everything.
Ordered this book after reading many reviews. I must say this book is written quite well. It does not add anything to the history or explore new avenues but gives the reader ample material to know about Chanakya. Ashwin Sanghi's writing style is lucid. He concentrates on the subject material than explaining the landscape and other details. He lets the reader to imagine the setting. Timepass stuff
Aware of its success in the market, i started this book with many expectations. The first few chapters, say a 60 pages, were extremely gripping and drew a sense of curiosity and excitement in me. And honestly i say, Aswin Sanghi did a good start for this book. The remaining part of the book made me feel worse. I just continued reading this book in hope to find a corner which would satisfy me but did not find anything of that sort. I pushed myself up to 400 pages but failed to complete it. And the movement i decided to stop reading and closed this book, i felt free. Though Ashwin Sanghi worked extremly hard for this book, which is clearly visible in this work, and well gifted with writing skills, he failed to produce a book woth reading.
Firstly, mind blowing service from flipkart. Ordered this book at 6pm and it was at my doorstep at 10 am the next day. But, the funny thing is that I finished reading the book quicker than the time it took to deliver it. Finished reading it in 10 hrs flat. I simply couldn't put it down. Absolutely riveting, it keeps the reader interested till the very end. Good work Ashwin Sanghi!!!
CC is quite an engaging weekend read for slow readers like me. The author's uncanny ability to keep any reader glued till the last page is truly "Remarkable" and the same goes for Flipkart's express delivery.
Awesome book. Informative, and has a wonderful plot. has tried to give two parallel stories at the same time and well he succeeds! a must read! A true page turner and worth buying. ............................................................................................
A story brilliantly told that will keep you seated till you finish it! One might feel that the ending was a bit rushed upon, still pacing the 2 stories millennia apart, parallelly, has been marvelously done my the author.
I enjoyed reading book. plots were very good. Didn't enjoyed any book as this. But i think that abusive words are used much. But all over book was really good. Will be reading The Rozabal Line now.
This book is a perfect book describing the modern day re-enactment of chanakya by a teacher. This book is one of my favourites and i recommend it to every person and everyone. This book also describes the great ability of Ashwin Sanghi as an author GO FOR IT
A good blend of ancient times with the modern age. Absolutely fast paced and thrilling. The uncanny portrayal of Gangasagar as the modern Chanakya is simply brilliant. Ashwin's capability of penning down espionage , murder, political sabotages and propaganda is simply awesome. A must read for all. Its like a modern day Mahabharata in a nutshell.
fast paced novel,who helped me to understand today's dirty politics and possibly how far so called briliinat politicians can go to achieve goals,may be stratigies written are imaginary but are close to be real one,i bow to writer for writig commendable events closely matching present day
I am surprised some people start a book with a preconception. This presumptuous attitude towards a story can kill the excitement. I bought this book as I am naturally attracted and attached to Indian mythology. This book starts at a slow pace for both the stories but gradually starts building up. Both the stories are very well written and I believe we should take inspiration from it in many ways. If our politicians could learn from it, I believe it would be boon for the nation. Agreed that the political plots in real life are not so straight but writer's comprehension is apt and the plot is amicable to the contemporary societies. I loved this book and learnt from it. One reason I like to read book is to learn. Without learning, books would have no meaning. Looking forward to more.
the plot/storyline is good, but the narration is bad. the author has tried to put the characters in excruciating detail, which is totally unnecessary and boring. I wasted my time reading this book.
Chanakya Chant is a fast paced double-thriller, merged beautifully at the end. The characters, Chanakya and Gangasagar, are intelligent, manipulative and grey. The way these two characters strategize and execute their cunning plans, keeps the reader guessing till the end. The thing that's most lovable about the book are the quotes used throughout the book (the references/sources of which have been given their due mention at the end). The parallel drawn between the historic and the present stories is refreshing, though the oscillating timelines can be a bit confusing, and at times, one might have to read back and forth through the pages, to catch up with the two story-lines and their characters. Chanakya Chant satiates with its spice and wit, and is a pure delight to indulge in!
Though it is slightly slow paced than my preferred genre of books, I enjoyed it greatly. There is no rising or falling action as dynamic as one sees in other books such as those of Dan Brown, but it certainly engages you through the ethos of both Chanakya, and Pandit Gangasagar Mishra. Though the long chapters in different eras may leave you slightly dazed as the storyline alternates, it definitely is a good read.
An absolute treat.. The two stories, the one in the past based on Chanakya and the present story that shows the dirty Indian politics played by Gangasagar Mishra are brilliantly written. The two stories alternate between one another that makes it a really gripping read. Do read this book, u'l love ashwin sanghi for sure
There are 2 stories that run in parallel with one in the past, the actual Chanakya era, and the other in the current. The chapters alternate in that order. You might start the book with a set of expectations, which are drained by the time the book is half complete. Was more like the movie Rajneeti being scripted. Because I ordered the book online, I compelled myself to finish half of it before I gave up!
now thats a real deal when it comes to story reading ........beautifully paced really we indians once were actual rulers of world waning from that height really requires ignorance and laziness which is very much true...till date there's no better politician and shrewd individual like Chanakya........loved every bit of its plotting and furious pace...completed in 1 sitting in a day....definite page turner
Fast paced, no-nonsense political thriller, shifting between Chanakya's cold & calculating politics from 500 BC to a modern day small-time-strategist turned kingmaker, emulating all his moves. Wonderfully engaging book and an enjoyable experience!
Chanakya's Chant is a very exciting book.It relates the modern day and modern politics with ancient times,2300 years ago that one can see the picture in front of the eyes.The plot moves in a swift pace but it manages to give the reader each and every detail of the locations.It is one of the best political thrillerand its adventurous plot inspires me read it 100 times.
it's a vary good fiction seen for a long time. But you cannot take it as refrence to history. I want to say to mr sanghavi you should not manipulate history to bring masala in your creation. Its not so good. But as a fiction its brilliant piece of copying caractors and story. Good work mr. Ashwin.
A mind bobbling and fascinating story where the author takes you 2300 years,back in history, also drawing a parallel with the modern day. Chanakya known as one of the most intelligent person has been reincarnated in the modern day and acted in the same manner as Chanakya displaying his unexceptional intellect in the true sense of the term. After The Rosabal Line,its worth reading.
this would give bollywood masala movies a run for its money. straight out of the script of a bollywood formula movie incuding the item numbers. just riding on the wave of history/mythology based books by others but a complete disaapointment. and for people who read real history this is just junk. Please, threw this in the dustbin. complete waste of money.
As ancient and sharp the Arthashastra is, Ashwin Sanghi presents the essence of it, intelligently advertising Chanakya and creating the ember of interest among his readers. When I read the book, I had to go back several times to understand what was happening. The read seems interesting, well-sped, well presented, witty and juicy. The language is just about reachable to the understanding of an average English guy. The story effectively steals the present nativity and relevance. 4 on 5 Kudos!
Well Done Mr. Sanghi! One of the best works in recent times. His narration style of 2 different periods (BC to AD) is really worked well. Usually, such strategy is a risk, but he handled it very well, of course with the research which he had done supported it. I give 5* to his 'planning' which he had done for writing this book.
I am not a big fan of fiction based on historical or religious belongings, but when a friend recommended a copy by Ahswin Sanghi’s Chanakya’s chant, I just went with the flow. And before I could sunk in the feeling of reading a historic fiction, I was reading the last lines of the book. Well no it sint a short book, its just fast and makes you keep turning the pages. It’s a story based in two separate time horizons. One in 500 BC and second is current. Writing skills of the author are uncanny and it’s a fast ride from there on. It’s a story about the great visionary and scholar ‘Chankya’ and current day political activist ‘Gangasagar’ trying to achieve same thing in two parallel universes. Trying to overthrow bad governance and leadership and take their protégés to the level of rulers. Fast, compulsive page turner, witty (author have mentioned the sources of those wicked one liners in the end), thought provoking. 4 stars for me.
In the book the history is adroitly related to modern fictional characters. Making of CHANDRA GUPTA and CHANDANI GUPTA. It is a story of revenge and patriotism. Sometimes when we are free from our daily stress of work we thing nowadays politics is dirty game of throne and power - true but it always has been from emergence of mankind. Not just Chanakya. Shakuni in Mahabharat was also and evil game player of politics of that time. Only change in modern politics is our politician forget there is something like country that is our responsibility. If you like politics somewhat than read this book. I bet you will not regret....
What a book... fantastic ... no other superlative would do justice to this piece of art. The beauty of the book is in its writing, in the parallels that the Ashwin draws between 2 eras seperated by 2300 years, in its unwritten climaxes to sub plots. Given a proper screenplay and cast, this book has all the ingredients to be a 100 crore+ blockbuster Hindi movie.. Excellent read.. highly recommended..
This one is a gem by Ashwin Sanghi..Absolutely fantastic..the characters have been portrayed in a very intelligent way..utv has already bought the movie rights..waiting for the movie now. The Mantra is very soothing and meaningful! ...loved the concept, plot, story line! a must buy for all!!
Heady cocktail of Power, Politics, and History. A compulsive page turner. Brilliant narration and its interweaved with historical anecdotes. Fresh characters, gripping sub-plots, and wide knowledge on the topics. Go for it -- STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.
The title does not require any pre-requisite. Just viewing the cover, one can guess as to which level of politics he is going to witness. And the parallel worlds simply groove up the way things can be manipulated and politically explored. A completely spellbounding work. And just a Hats-off wont be true justice...!!!
Simply brilliant. Its almost lieka psychological thriller. And i like the way Ashwin moves from the current day to Chanakya's time. Also applaudable is the "credits" he honestly gives to people from whom he has borrowed lines am proud to say, an Indian author has arrived !!!
This is a master piece of work by Mr. Ashwin Sanghi The story telling is awesome... Any review can never be finished without writing about flipkart. These guys are awesome when it comes to customer satisfaction and delivery
Things I liked: 1. Two stories running parallel 2. Fast pace 3. Worth each and every penny paid!! This is one of the best books in my library... liked the way the story flows. I was not much aware of Chanakya's life story, so this was an added advantage for me.
Bought the e-book. Liked the depiction of the past to present portrayal of the author. Amazing sense. Loads of effort, background check and research have gone behind this classy work. Took me almost 6 hours split between 4 days to finish reading.
Loved this tale of deceit, intelligence and politics all interwoven with threads of love, lust and one-upmanship...definitely among the real good ones I have read so far...would love to lay my hands on the other 2 books of Sanghi in the near future!
was expecting a lot after hearing dan brown comparison. but it pales in comparison to his works. the problem lies in characters behavior which matches with bollywood stereotypes.also the Language used is not quite authentic ( i.e used in ancient india) and quite coarse .also coming from orissa which was used in reference as kalinga in a chapter it could have been better if we had a name for our ruler( naming it as just kalinga was a insult.)overall, it might be a good hindi movie but in literary sense not much.
i read all the three books of ashwin sanghi, chanakyas chant, rozabel line and krishna key. If you are a real fiction lover, these books should decorate your personal library. All the three books are unique in their theme and nowhere you will find any similarity. Each book is set in an entirely different platform. If you want to spend on fiction books, consider the said three books.
Chanakya's chant is definitely ashwin sanghi's best work till date. It was a definite page turner and kept me interested from the very beginning upto the very end.The contrast between the kingmaker of the ancient era and the witty politician of modern time is remarkably pictured by ashwin sanghi.He gave a wonderful insight not only to the life and times of the pre-mauryan period but also to the corruption and divisive politics of modern India.I strongly recommend it for all to read and i am sure that it will be an awesome experience for all.A handful Indian authors like Ashwin Sanghi,Chetan Bhagat and Amish Triparthy are still making us proud and i have to say chanakya's chant worked for me. Hats off...........!!!!!!!
First i read The Krishna Key and then Chanakya's Chant and both the books had 2 things in common . The books were difficult to put down and keeps you engaged . However when it came to end they both could have had a better ending . Lets hope that The Rozabal Line have a good story and a good ending .
The writing style of the author is simple to read and understand. The 2 stories run parallel to each other and are very creatively mended together. Chanakya's story is already known to many of us. Ashwini has just moulded the facts into this amazing work of fiction. On the other hand, the story about Gangasagar Mishra has been brilliantly written. Its a must read book. go for it.
I started this book bcoz of fascination with Chanakya- I recently watched the Chanakya serial full episodes and really admired his ability to make people act his way.. but while reading this book, i was forced to compare between the two- book and video for incidents that actually happened and sadly, there were lots of differences plus the incidents in book kind of get repetitive , giving a sense of dragging through to smhow complete the book. Thats what i did, "smhow i finished reading the book".
I found the history part interesting. However, the way it goes was dragging and the 100 pages was very difficult to finish because of the course of events so obvious. On and all, its a fairly written book. I give it a 3 star.
The book is divided between the past and the present times. Though it revolves around on Chankya's deeds, its adaption in the modern world is more engrossing. This is probably because the built up of the story is more eventual and well done for the modern times. But overall quiet gripping and a good read!
from childhood onwards i used to like chanakya and wanted to know who actually he was.......and i thank both flipkart and ashwin sanghi to provide me such a awesme book!! this book is not just based on politics but one can also find fun and some times goosebumssssssss!!!!!
There are few authors in India who write exceptionally well. Ashwin is one of those. I am a vivid reader and read almost all the books that come my way. This stands first. 1. Chanakya Chant- Ashwin 2. Journey Of Two Hearts- Anuj Tiwari 3. How I braved Any Aunty - Varun Aggarwal 4. Life is what you make it- Preeti
I ordered two of Ashwin's books: Chanakya's Chant and Krishna Key to keep myself occupied on my flight journey to the US and back. And here I am, having finished the book and my journey hasn't even started. If one were to say, "Unputdownable is an understatement" - then 'understatement' in itself would be an understatement. Totally loved every bit of it !! I'm still wondering how Shashi-ji could have possibly left the book halfway ahead of the launch.
A beautiful insight in to the mind of the most clever strategist in history, and also his impeccable replica of modern times. The story keeps you thrilled from the very beginning. You are left wanting for more at the end of each chapter. Two different stories are very well balanced by the author, and you can even relate between the two. It literally transports you to a different world, from where you find hard to get out.
Very plainly surfaced story with good masala. Relativity between 3rd century BC and current story is outstanding. Though Gangasagar Mishra appears very mundane these days; the blend between two stories; sticks us onto the books pages till the end.
With some many giving rave reviews about this book, I wanted to read for myself what could be called as India's answer to Dan Brown. The first 100 pages was worth it. Character depth, love, emotion was captured very well. After that, it was complete politics. I was bored and had to stretch to finish the book. The author failed to create the initial hype through the latter part of the book. As a reader, I had to turn my pages fast just to get to the end. The last few pages brought some life back. However, the book could have been better.
Getting started with this: It is about (you can read it on last cover page). The tactful representation of 2 sides of the story and unexpected way of alliances was a real thrill! Never knew so much about Chanakya, all I knew was that he united various kingdoms... but, the story line both matched with present world and 2300 years ago... as a player places his steps and saves the kingdom by moving each meticulous steps of queen, elephant and tactful horse... a chess of a greater wisdom! Too GOOD!!!
This book contains a historically accurate and interesting description of Chanakya's life and works. This book is suitable for people of all ages because of its versatility. A must-buy for any history enthusiast.
It is a nice read which makes you sit up and say 'Ah! so that's what might have happened' Its a 'Don't miss' read which would entertain you through the pages. One more in this category dear author, integrating the various political twists and turns that real life offers would be a delight.
I had high expectations of this book since it used the name of a person who knew military and economy much before these words were even coined. But I was sorely dissapointed after reading this book. The few things I noticed while reading are: 1. The language used is exceptionally common even when the writer is writing about more than 2000 years ago. A little research here would have added value to reading. 2. The only possible solution to every problem that modern day Gangasagar Mishra faces seems to be blackmail and murder. After a certain point this 'scheme' becomes repetitive and you can guess what Gangasagar is 'scheming'. 3. The transformation in Gangasagar is so sudden that you are left wondering what made him into a genius of politics suddenly. 4. While Chanakya played a real time chess with kings and rulers of ancient India, the book somehow fails to depict it in a manner which would have made it more intriguing. 5. To end it - Gangasagar is in no way Chanakya.
Enjoyed all through the reading. the quick change over between time periods added much to the thrill. I personally like the narration during the 340 BC time line. don't miss if you do like political thrillers
One of first thing u note about the book and Mr sanghi's writing is that the pace never slackens off.It oscillates effortlessly between past and present and keeps the reader hooked with ease.Sometimes in the middle you do feel the story is stagnating and feel what next? but the writer arrests your attention again with his fabulously schemed story.Overall it's a wonderful read and i recommend this to everyone who looks to have a good time.
The book is quite interesting till around half mark. The concept o f narrating the ancient and contemporary simultaneously is fine. But later on, the ancient part is digestive being history, however, the present appears to be incomprehensible and filmy and resembles a bollywood script. The language is good with stingy sprinkling of humour. Be that as it may, the book is very good for brisk reading and enjoyable.
i impulsively bought this novel.i had not read any ashwin books before buying this.really i was hardly cheated after reading this novel.Things have changed lot recent days.but this writer still strongly supports Hinduism.that too portrayed Brahmins as children of god.friends never encourage such a things in this scientific world.Be aware.....
Brilliant book on Indian Mythology.....The author, Ashwin Sanghi shares an interesting imaginative comparison between the two main characters in the story, Chanakya and Pandit Gangasagar Mishra. This political thriller is a must read for everyone.
It was fun to read. I like reading book related to Indian society but could not decide or find correct books. This book is somehow related to Indian society even if the story is made around real story. It is super tasty book to read. I am not a book reader as you know many. But I completed this book in 1-2 months.
A real page turner which gives insights of the Indian politics. It can easily be related to the current politics by one and all..nicely built upon the strong character and intellect of Chanakya. The transformation of present situation and the moves made by Chanakya has been extraordinary. It has all the qualities of turning out to be a feature film and I am not surprised that UTV motion pictures has bought the rights.
First of all, thank you Flipkart! Making this book or for that matter, other books so easily available at such a convenience to an avid book reader like myself, is something which I am really Thankful for. “The Rozabal Line” was very disappointing, but Chanakya’s Chant is a totally different and Brilliant book. This is one of the BEST and enjoyable reads I’ve had in a long time, I have not met a single person who does not like this book. It’s impossible to put down once you start reading it. The book transports you in time to the far away land of Magadha and the parallel stories of the past and the present are so effortlessly blended that you don’t want the story to end. The one liners, proverbs and quotes are so intelligent and mind gripping. Though you may have heard them somewhere, you don’t really mind that they are repeated here. My husband who is not interested in reading is now a convert! Thanks to this book  It’s a must read, and no second thoughts if you want to go ahead!
