2 States _ The Story Of My Marriage@@@With this book turning into a movie, I thought why not give it a read. The usual drama unfolds. Two people meet, fall in love and agree to get married. It doesn't end there. The journey between the agreement and the actual act is gruesome. Often folks within the same communities face huge challenges to marry someone whom they truly desire. It is coincidental that the author finds 2 states to deal with here or rather two cultures. What I like about the book is that both parties understand that Marriages in India are all about marrying families and they didn't give up on their parents despite of having found their soul mate. A good way to tell the world that no matter how much we progress in this world, relationships matter & one can't give up all of it for one's own sake. It's a fast, one time read but won't find a place in your book shelf.
Chetan bhagat is just very good in drawing attention of teens and college going guys. A must read book for love birds. Just awesome description and writing........ And flipkart as usual good in delivery and very nice packing...
{ It Had To Be You and 2 States } took my hearts. Must read books. The lang used in the book in such a great way. I have read only sample chapter of these books but ordered and eagerly waiting to read it soon
Very Heart Touching & Pretty Story it has all element in it, its will make you laugh, make you cry also make you trust on your love & on your own, Must read by everyone...
It is the amazing book I've ever read. Love to read it again and again. I'm totally addicted to '2 States'. The best love story of two Indians from different culture. I want to read this book before I go for a movie. So, I've ordered this book from Flipkart. And I received it only in 2 days. Great service by Flipkart. Chetan Bhagat is the best author. I'm the biggest fan of Chetan Bhagat. 2 States is the best book.
Beauty of Life comes in small thing...the same way Chetan's novels have captivated a whole new genre of readers..who have the power to transform our nation.His message is clear..the narrow boundaries of States should fall before India the Nation and ofcourse love proves the tool to do away with such ills..Yeah!!I loved this novel in that way...the tone of Chetan's novels always present the story frankly and reading novels about things of our own lyf truly stir our memories.
i want to read the book,before its movie release and now book is in my hand.the movies doesnt give pleasure as compare to movie hats off to chetan bhagat!!!
"2 States" & "It Had To Be You" - Same writing style- Rupa Publications Best books. Being a reviewer, moreover a reader I came to know few similar books which are published by Rupa Publications. I have read all books and feel good when I read them.
I read One night @ Call Center. From then I am a fan of Chetan Bhagat. This is another masterpiece from Chetan Sir.
amazing story of an ideal punjabi family and an ideal tamil brahmin society enjoy a lot................
It is a nice love story and feels like it is our own love story :). Flipkart delivery is just great as usual.
I had reviewed this book before too but I now deleted that after reading full book Previously I gave it 2 stars but this time 3 The story is quite good and fine but the part in the mid of the book (when krish goes to chennai to join his office as well as to impress ananya's parents) is too boring.I mean he has introduced his work at that extent in that part (Office work) that I almost gave up to this novel and wrote review that it is too stretched but once when we finish that part its too gripping So 3 stars from my side.
u must read this book as its love story, very nicely written as u all know its chetan bhagat . product was delivered on time and wonderfully packed
The two states book is very nice than the last book... Again a hit by bhagat.. And Thanks for Flipkart for delivering quick....
The book is an amazing love story. It is not only about love but also LIFE. I am sure this book can transform many peoples lives.
no words to appreciate chetan bhagat .he has given his best in all books besides two states always stands first.hats off to chetan bhagat.nothing is missing in story .full of humor ,emotion,love,sentiments etc..everybody must read this book.
Super Book....... it z very low price..it will be deliveried in time.... Flipkart is asome site for users...we will purchase any item with low cost.... Thanks to Flipkart
It was a fun joyride and gave an idea on how Punjabis are like. 2 States is all about how Krish and Ananya convinces their parents and get approval for their marriage. Punjab weds Tamil Nadu.
bookz amazing, author amazing.everything is amazing in this book.this is the second book of chetan bhagat.the second world war.
Think that Mr.Chetan Bhagat has caught up with some kinda of mental illness while writing this book. And his description about the tamilian people is completely biased making them look like they are always inferior to them. And that comment about LTTE is completely unbearable. What the hell does he know about our people?? U guys sitting in northern india will never understand our sentiments. He should first better learn how things work out here rather than making racist comments about the south indian people. I didn't expect this from the author of his stature. It took days to come out of my stress after reading this book. Nice try Mr.Bhagat come back better next time against us.
With a very happy tale, related simply, and in a linear fashion. Life of a North indian guy piling on to a South indian girl, and then they live happily ever after, with loads and loads of cliches and stereotypes thrown in for free. All good fun. Sure to pull the plum on people from everywhere!! Disclosure - I am married to a South Indian myself. doesn't get better. 34th year and counting.
Chetan just rocks in this book.the stories amazing,languages simple,just a perfect love story between two indians. MUST READ.
Chetan Bhagat's best work ever. The story is very good and keeps you related. Not very filmy and more of simple and realistic. The one disappointing thing is that the book contains some of adult stuff which is kind of normal, so young teenagers should not really read this one, but still a book to buy as of the story and the concept of the book.
2 States:The Story of My Marriage by Chetan Bhagat, is an excellent book. After reading the whole book you will never feel that you have wasted your time. Go for it....
The author has elaborated his experience in a more romantic way. Sure, Everyone will love this book. As i am tamilian and a chennai boy, i enjoyed reading this book! Chetan Bhagat at his best.
Really amazing book, after reading i came 2 know so many things about love n marrige, all my concepts , fundamentals and doubts got cleared during these 5days. Friends please go for it. It will definitely change ur behaviour,thinking process, attitude,feelings towards girls,cultures and marrige. You will become mature n its effects will b reflected dealing with ur partner. Those who believe in love marrige pls go for it, it will strengthen ur will power n those who don't believe also go for it, it will definitely motivate you to fall in love....
MY SECOND LOVE STORY BOOK........ AFTER READING THIS BOOK ONE CAN GET IDEA HOW TO CONVINCE THEIR PARENTS FOR THEIR LOVE AND MAKE THE MARRIAGE AS "LOVE ARRANGED".........
A beautiful love story by bhagat.It was as if i was involved in the story. After reading this my desire to find my true love intensified. Eagerly waiting for the release of this movie.
Very nice book one thing that i did throught the book is laugh and laugh aloud, really nice and must read for all ,started liking bhagats writing after this book
This book is what I'm searched to begin the habit of book reading. I had completed this book in a of train journey. Its narrated very good and the interest of the person who read this book is keep on going until the last page.
Loved it completely!! Beautifully written.. for a person like me who really is not fond of reading novels,i loved it! Keeps u glued to it from the start to the very end.. a v cute love story indeed :) Its a must read u guys ;) And like always ..flipkart makes sure u wil get it neatly packed without a scratch :D
Well its not written to that level what we expect from chetan bhagat(as we expect much more especially after reading 3mistakes)...hope to see more from the author..! Its not the way 3 mistakes is written but definately creates a good emphasis on readers minds.....not toooooo good but atleast one time read..!
2 States: The Story of My Marriage by Chetan Bhagat, is excellent book. I can bet that after reading the whole book you will never feel that you have wasted your time. Surely, you will gather huge knowledge.
am impressed with this story, good book and thanks for flipkart..every problems having a solution, but we should accept either good or bad result...choosing lifepartner is a critical stage of everyones life,am believing this book helps for those who are in love and who wants to fall in love..

good book which deeply involve with indian culture,relations and love...........don't get bore when reading this book .........i definetly say"u will be a fan of chetan bhagath after reading this book"
Its a complete romantic story and the love life of chetan bhagat. He really narrated this story in a pleasant way. Whenever am reading this story i feel like i went to that situation. so his narration is good. Friends please read this book and you too have a good experience.
"WORTH EVERY PENNY". Grab this book now. Love story that motivates you and tells you life is hard and test you at every moment but the beauty lies in not giving up. A wonderful novel to read by chetan bhagat.
2 States is one of the most beautiful love story I have ever read..It is so very down to earth and quiet near to the reality of life.. I have read the book approx 1.5 year back and have gifted the same to 3/4 of my friends.. its a MUST READ BOOK :)
2 states is like a poor old screenplay of a 10 yr old bollywood movie. Mr.Bhagat doesn't seem to express any thoughts.. all he wanted to do is giving something to a specified group of readers, to impress them. The jokes are too old and characterization is so poor. This one is not even worth for 90 RS. Try to get any dickens Classics @ this price..
The story of his love, his college, his fight for the love of his life, undying hope, trip into depression and finally his marrage is the story that many Indians would relate to.The book has a perfect balance of side-splitting humor, tear producing emotions and a true Indian feel to it. It makes an amazing read not once but many times over. Chethanji's knack of moulding the story from a scene to other with perfect transitionary elements makes me rank the book a full score A must read!
Amazing Book....... Its really a international book which has to be rated full stars to it nice book must read as my self as an iit scholar all iit studets must read the book from an iitian the book has done amazing work all over
Many reviews say this is the best, I found 5 point someone as my favorite. This is a very close second. He has painted an accurate picture of Chennai and south India. Even though it was a busy day at work I finished this off in less than 24hrs after it was delivered to me. Guess that says a lot about the book :)
this is truly the best book written by chetan bhagat so far. rest of his books were good,but this was just superb!!!!!!! while reading this book i somewhat felt like as if the book was a bit connected with five point someone. i felt so as when krish (the main character) tells why he actually ended up in IIM to Ananya, the flashback part seemed like hari's(the one from five point someone). This is what atleast i felt. This is a must read for everyone from children to adults.
I just adore this book. It has been my favourite so far. I loved the way Bhagat blended in both comedy and romance and how brilliantly he made it fathomable that love knows no bounds. It just happens. ;)
A most hilarious book published by Chetan Bhagat so far. On the contrary, the profound tale that he ever weaved, according to me, was Five Point Someone. I thought Five Point Someone did have some basic literary quality to it. All other books that came after were mere "school or college tales". Perhaps, Three Mistakes of My Life was a close second. Chetan Bhagat books are a study in simplicity and basically not to be taken seriously. One primary element is that he manages to pull off the whole account quite convincingly, the story propels ahead into simple and sensible finale. Nothing â€œliterary fictionâ€� about his books and none should be taken as anything near that suggestion. If any â€œwriterâ€� is clever enough to do that, then 50% of the fight is already won and you can move on and dub yourself as an author. (Of course! The other 50% is the publisherâ€™s nightmare to live and tell the publishable tale!).
This one is a light hearted, comedy, fun and frolic ride, which is definitely worth taking, but only ONCE! Nothing extraordinary, but overall, an entertaining one! Specially the 'mickey-mouse' underwear! Hahaha, I still laugh at that!
I really like the book, it keeps u bound till the end, so many things r there which u can corelate to ur self if u have ever been in this situation. I really like chetan bhagat's writting it's so simple yet elegant. A must read book of ........chetan bhagatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
This is an exellent love story i have ever read...., and yes somewhere on the line i also feel in that boys plays .., this book helped me a lot as well as my lover ... She had now a great confidence to our marriage first she used to afraid a lot but now.... YOu done my work Thank you so much Great book must read...
I am a chetan bhagat fan. this book is his best novel.i have read this one possibly 100 times and still love it.his one liners..characters you can relate to..and it is a love story with an important message.
The best of Chetan Bhagat's works. What an amazing love story it is. Started as the same college love stories, but as and when it went on, it clearly showed the next step for a couple in love. The way they convince their parents was superb. The epilogue was mast!! I wish one day i too have such a good love story in my life, which i can atleast share with my children. :) Hats off Chetan Bhagat
According to me, Two States was one good read. A breather after Chetan Bhagat's sad attempt with 'Three Mistakes of my Life'. Love Stories are always welcome :) A book, I can read again and again. Thumbs up to Two States
This book is the best work of Chetan Bhagat as far as my opinion goes. I am not sure how much close is it to the real marriage story of him, but it is a delightful read. The concept of getting two different cultures close and eliminating the gap between the same is very good.
Third book in my reading carrier.I am happy because my third choice is as fantastic as my first 2 choice and more interesting.It was a new experience to me.This love story has something different to tell and we can also feel it as we move through the book.The language is simple.The book is truly awesome and forced me to buy other books of the author.......................
this is probably chetan bhagat's best book till date..its thoroughly entertaining from the first page...be it his sexy one liners,reflection of parental attitude towards inter-community marriages etc....everything was in the right place...he also conveyed a much needed message right now to India through this book....there were some negatives like its a predictable plot but the humor makes up for everything.....read it....i bet you want to read it again for its one liners
Mr. Chetan Bhagat greatly brings out the conditions, prejudices, and superstitions prevailing in the so-called 'DIVERSE' Indian society. A really inspiring story about two young lovers who overcome regional bias and wins over all others to unite for LOVE. However as compared to a few othe rbooks that i've read, this seemed a little bit boring to me. But it does convey a message to look at seriously, so that regional prejudices can be wiped out completely from the minds of YOUNG INDIA, and INDIA gets united to progress.
this is the cheap book written by chetan bhagat... no need to read it. this type of books will spoil the younger generations. this book also brings dominance of one region on the other . mentioning a group of people on the caste based and blaming them is is not correct.. dividing people on the name of region and showing dominance by one region over the other is not so good for the developing nation like INDIA.using the names like IIT AND IIM and showing the students from that institutes as a sexual interest guys is not so correct..plz remove the names based on caste,region and reputed institutions. fianlly, this is the worst book with no use to any geneeration pupil.
This Was The Third Novel Of Chetan Bhagat I ve Read And I Must Say I Have Not Read An Intresting Story Like This.It Has Every Thing In Itself This Is A Complete Pakage. And It Is My Favorite Novel YEt...
i enjoyed, especial krish's mother charater. love in the begining and the fight between 2 communities are @ the best
Well, the story is okay going from one state to another about love, and friendship. The writer gives good picture about the culture and daily life of the people in the two states. The characterization is also good with a varied range of characters.
i hav read thiz book...liked it....flipkart ur delivery tymin so gud!!!but not find anything to learn or inspirin!!so gud for tympass!!!even revolution 2020 was good tym pass!!!but noe guyz reading god of small things,....!!!i hav got the intrest of reading book through flipkart!!!/:Pyup thts true !!
When i have heard about this book..from my friends, i was too eager to read.After that i have decided to go with flipkart and ordered it. Delivery was before time !!! Kudos to flipkart.OK, now lets talk about book, I would say hats off to Chetan to write such a great book which contains love, culture and higher study mixture. This is a typical indian book, written with great dedication which immensely tends to towards indian society and their traditions, also a man fight against these customs.I would highly recommend go for it.
well..........'jab kuch achha lagta hai to vo mushkil hoke bhi asaan ho jaata hai!' bought this novel from a flee market with purpose of learning english as advised by someone and to my amazement i found it intriguing me to read further. as i was a beginner so it took me 1 month to go through it.for me it was a wonderful experience to learn as well as delight. In the country like India where love story is the best amusement being provided by yashraj films, Chetan sir also served the same & he has got a new idea to unite the nation.the book has got a well description of heroine girl daring to change the system & she did.Being prurient i had savored every line from chetan g's kiss to their coitus.in this book one can get chance to explore the dishes of kerala. i wonder if i may get such a gorgeous lady............. well what i m writing today in english is the gift of this book. but.but .............i m still in confusion how author's grumpy father suddenly changed into a loving papa! and my advice if u r still reading it ...."must buy for who is in love or who was in love because it will show you the way to turn your lovemaking into your official honeymoon!!!!!!
Yes... this book clearly shows how majority of indian families react/behave when they are confronted by their children regarding their choice of partner from a totally different caste.. the taunts,puns etc are beautifully described!! A worth reading book! Once again a wonderful work by Chetan Bhagat!
This book contains a nice story and the plot is rather different but I also want to say that it is too boring to read.If you are going for an interesting one then never take this book by mistake also coz I am telling you after reading this book you will say 'I want to refund the money I paid for this book'
Read it for the 2nd time. This is one best works of Chetan Bhagat. A must read. This book is also great mood lifter. Read it when you feel depressed; it will cheer you up!! Chetan Bhagat has captured the Tamil and Punjabi cultures in its most authentic form. While he made fun of both Punjabis and Tamils but his love, affection and respect for both the cultures were conspicuously evident. The romance of two highly educated young people displayed the mind frame of the generation in lucid way. Read and enjoy!!
This is my first book by Chetan Bhagat Sir. I found it very interesting, they create eagerness in you about up comings in story so you stick to the book without keeping it down. About Story. Its really nice, having description of lots of ups and downs in love story + humor generated by situations and thinking of the writer and many more. I truly appreciate the efforts of the writer for writing such a nice book. Thank You.
Okay, So I am not a very experienced reader (I am only 17).. and I do not know the defination of 'good writing' but my experience with this book is very different. I have lost count of how many times I have read this book. whenever I start reading it, it makes me laugh. whenever I am feeling depressed, I randomly open any page of this book.. and It makes me smile. It is like a friend..I agree that Chetan Bhagat's other books are crap (revolution 20-20 is the biggest disappointment ever) but 2-states surely is a great work. It is light and full of slapstick comedy with a cute storyline. All I can say is that this book is really special to me and I do recommend it to those who want some fun reading.
A perfect love between Ananya and Krish,ended happily.I want my love to end as like their love,with parents blessings. Eagerly Waiting for that day!!!!!!.The day that happens i too had a love story in my own life .Ha Ha !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So another great story by chetan bhaghat......another boy stressed in life bw his family love career and all....in short a great package for entertainment......i am reading it...its half completed....and till now its amazing.....BUY IT....................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
It's a simple, sweet and a typical Indian love story and has traces of bollywood kind of Masala...It's worth reading for those who do not want to go for a very intense novel...... Good work by chetan Bhagat...
one of the best story i ever read by any of the writer in this world...!!! the way he makes us... to imagine the scenes with her girlfrnd makes me so romantic (type feeling)_.. its all awwwsssmmmeeee.. yarr 5 stars frm ma side..
This book is a brilliant encouragement for those who are in love , esp. with one out of their caste or state . The main moral is that " trust your love and never be afraid of struggle " .. because without struggle , life is dead meat and struggles refine and increase the intensity of your love .
My 2nd pick from Chetan's collection - am still carrying that positive impression about the author - perfectly suits my taste. A simple, realistic & all too natural tale of two individuals who chose to adopt the right approach of establishing their love & seek blessings of their families. Indeed, a rightfully crafted storyline with immense sensitivity to traditional values & culture - that is convincingly portrayed & exhibited by lead characters. Loved the book for it's simple yet gripping content; ensuring that I stay connected with Chetan Bhagat as a 'LOYALIST'. Am looking forward to start another title from this talented author's collection...
This is my first Chetan Bhagat Novel and I must say I was impressed. The language was simple and the humour really makes you laugh which not all books are capable of!! A good book for light reading!!
I had a soft copy of this book and unlike others I could finish in few days as I was reading few pages a day as time permitted but I was so excitedly waiting to read the coming pages everyday. I really like the story and way it is narrated. I think its not only a love story but also a reflection of relationships we share with different people and their value in our lives. Since I am married to a Punjabi family I could easily relate to the narrations which is so so true. Keep coming more good work of yours. Thank You Chetan ji.
best book i ever read .. and its my very like book after the notebook by ns.. thnk u sooo much chetan ji. i always read thhis book when i am soo happy... because some lines of this book is cant replace by any1.. very moving book.. 1 problem is its quite small book..:)
After Five Point Someone, Chetan Bhagat has deliver a pretty nice store of '2 states'. I shall say 2 States is just like cocktail with multiple flavour in it. Nice book for entertainment and time pass. The story is very realistic one. I personally have enjoy the story a lot.
This is so far the best book of Chetan Bhagat. I am a 69 years old person and is a bookworm who is hardened both by age and experience. Credit therefore must go the author for making me laugh heartily on three occasions during the passage of the book. A must read for everyone.
I finished the book in a single day.Just kept on reading and reading.Woow...the narration of the story just held me tight could not even think of doing a different thing. Being a true Chetan Bhagat fan can't expect more.As the story proceeds I felt like living the character of my own. A must buy and a must read for every Literature lover. Chetan Bhagat ROCKS.... :D :D
this book is must for those, who have a plan to set their love life........it tells about the love, emotions, sacrifices, joys and sorrows in the way of love... i completed it in one go.. ananya and krish god bless you forever.. the best scene was when krish goes to ananya's parents and presents a ring for oll..... waoooo cb...rocks
Don't just think to buy or not to buy! just grab it as soon as possible.Wonderful book.Describes how a guy can not only get along well with a girl but also with her family too.He has also depicted whether you are north Indian or South Indian love has no limits!!Waiting for your other new works Chetan sir!!!
This is nicely written book by Chetan who captures the love story of a north Indian boy with a south Indian girl.There is lot of humor in the story telling which captivate the readers interest. A pleasant book for light reading.
it started as all other CB books would start , i noticed that it has " glue" effect but it does not is the best one . it will take you along the typical indian familes , their nature towards each other etc !! just one time read !!!
A story which, besides having its own ups and lows, takes the reader as well into the roller coaster of drama, drama and drama which ultimately gets a little too monotonous. Although the plot goes like a bollywood flick, the book is written in a really captivating style. Great characterization and use of language. Chetan Bhagat does a good job altogether.
I didnt expect to like this book given what seemed like a cliched bollywood storyline of boy-meets-girl, parents-butt-in. It was a lot better than that and by the end I was rooting for both characters. Chetan Bhagat does such an excellent job of portraying the small and big obstacles that are thrown in the way of the couple that I cant help thinking it is very autobiographical. Or that Chetan Bhagat is really a better writer than everyone gives him credit for. The sex scenes are hilariously bad and mercifully brief. The guy comes off as a bit of an asshole initially but softens as the story progresses. Overall a surprisingly good light read
This is sooo nice, that i finished reading it in a single shot, the moment it came to me.To Mr.Chetan Bhagat,Sir, your books are MARVELS..... This book gives a new perspective mixed with Reality to the Love Affairs.... I love it. I recommend this for all youth...They definitely will love it .I even finished revising it 3 or 4 times.
When i first started reading the book, i found it to be boring but soon, i found the events are quickly taking place one after the other with a sequence in such a way that you may feel the urge of knowing more and knowing the result. The writing style is very humorous and has come out due to powerful observation skills of Mr Chetan Bhagat. Personally i feel, this is the best book he has written so far, which is socially inspiring as well as humorous. WELL DONE!
I read this novel 3 yrs back,, this is ma fav love story based novel.. juss loved everything about it.. best love story by chetan bhagat... i m die hard fan of this novel... :) :) :) i always recommend this novel to my friends and colleagues
2 states is an amazing book and can be considered one of the best works by the author. It keeps your eyes fixed and stops you from doing any other work. I bought the book from Kolkata railway station while I was heading towards New Delhi on Rajdhani express and finished it by the time the train reached Allahabad and I could not sleep the whole night. The author has very playfully taken on Citi Bank and the south Indian community. This book is the best work by Chetan Bhagat till date.
Have read all books by him till now and I can tell that it undoubtedly is the best work of CB yet. Can't put it down once you start reading it, and can relate to it really well. phrases used for south or north Indians presented in most non-offensive and entertaining way by CB(I believe only he has done it so far). Just go for it and know yourself.
Finished the book in 8 hrs.The fresh humour,the lifelike characters,the wonderful story,everything was so perfect!!A really really great read.....................................................................
Wonderful book that keeps the reader engaged throughout. The author has described and written his actual story in an excellent way. Chetan Bhagat has portrayed the north and south Indian Culture in a very good way. The situation in which the marriage happened was shown in a wonderful way.
I am Single and never had a GF.though i felt the pain in my hearth when i read the book.it was really amazing and Superb.CB rocks again after 3 mistakes.Sir please Do writing many more.please try the next based on a Real life story like this book
This was my first book and i loved it all by heart i really like the story and all praises to the writer chetan bhagat, i dont say he's a great writer becuase all other book written by him doesnt convenced me a lot like this one. only i can say is i m in love with this boook.
2 States has beautifully describe the difference of Culture and thought of two familes who lives in different states. In had make many punches in his own (Punjabi) Society as well as in South indian society. The story is very well narrated & do not loose it's weight. You will not get bored at any point of time. The way of writting of CB & punches force a reader to smile.
Luckily this was the first book which i have read of "Chetan Bhagat". And I have became his "Die hard Fan" now. what a Book... I have no words to express!!! while reading I was totally involved the story and I could literally feel the emotions of the characters. This book will always be there in My Collection.
2States Chetan Bhagat's another novel which is filled with full of exaggeration , this novel tells about the authors life how he found his girl, and he talks about the states of two of them (the author and his wife ) 2 states is a another novel based on LOVE, and how these two people make it in the end the author has taken the story in a good way by mentioning the culure of their states and by adding some characters inside ..so 2 states is a book which is based on the love life between two TOPPERS who study in IIMA and how they make in the end ..the author has spiced the story by mentioning about the states Tamil nadu and punjab ..worth buying it
The book moves around a punjabi and a tamil girl who r in love but there parents dont approve of d marriage because of the obvious reason... The different cultures... !! Typically the actual position of indin love nd marriages today... The book goes through many ups and downs but yet seems quite realistic... And not only showcases about newday indian marriages but alo touches many topics like the golorious life of iit'ans that most of us wanna experience.. (lol) .. How people mke fool of their clients at the banking scene.. And how domestic violence is still very much prominent in india.. Overall the book is a nice timepass and enjoyable.. Itz fun enough to read and has a decent humor quotent in it... I personally liked the book and must rcommend to everyone...
A very interesting comparison between the two culture's has been shown ( punjabi & tamilian) which are completely diverse from each other. Being a punjabi myself could really relate to it. Enjoyed reading it thoroughly.
The story is all about the struggle the couple has over cultural differences. The best part of the story is when they choose to convince the family and how they take through it. A good one and a must read for youngsters who are in love.
A wonderful love story, which along with the sweet taste of love makes us feel sour on how the communal system is still discriminating though we say we are in 21 Century. I completed the story at a stretch in a matter of 2 hours and reading it again and again... Hats off to Chetan
Three books and one movie strong, Chetan Bhagat has indeed become a name to reckon with. More than a youth icon, heâ€™s become a celebrity himself. Fact is, it actually took him three years to graduate to being a full-time writer. And with each book, heâ€™s improved a lot. A hell lot, Iâ€™d say. â€˜Two Statesâ€™ catapults the 35 year old author to the top rung of all Indian authors in English. The storyline of the book is predictable from the feel-good titling itself. Two protagonists â€“ Krish Malhotra (a punjabi) and Ananya Swaminathan (a tamilian) are classmates at IIM Ahmedabad. A rendezvous at the college canteen bonds them together, and in a matter of weeks (or rather, days) the duo are sleeping together in hostel rooms. Love blossoms, and by the time the duo pass out of college, theyâ€™ve decided to get married to each other. The hurdles seem insurmountable in the beginning â€“ jarring differences between their parents, their cultures and the language barrier being the reasons. Krish gets himself posted in Citibank chennai, where Ananya is working with HLL, and sets the ball rolling. Their carefully-crafted plans suffer occasional hindrances and at one point in time, the entire affair goes topsy turvy but things magically (I repeat, magically) get sorted out with the typical, happily-ever-after-Bhagat-climax.
It's a really nice love story.. Only got to know that it was chetan's personal one after completing the book.. Intresting one.. The challenges those faced by both the characters 'krish' and 'Annya' does resemble a real life love story...
Like Red says in The Shawshank Redemption, "It's just shitty pipe dreams". Nothing will happen if you don't read it. Yet another bollywood script. Chetan is a good writer. Please discourage this work so we can get better out of him.
reading 2 states is totally a time waste. the book is full of masalas.the author is just writing his stupid imaginations.this kind of book will make the youths think in wrong way. please dont buy this book and waste time. it is better to read the books like target 3 billion(apj abdul kalam), dreams from my father (barack obama), wings of fire(apj abdul kalam), india 2020(apj abdul kalam),Ignited Minds(apj abdul kalam) or imaging india(nandan nilkani). reading these kind of book will give us the idea and knowledge which is required for coming days because all these book are written by very experienced personalities. youths should read these book rather than going behind stupid books 2 states written by inmatured authors like chetan bhagat. it is very much shame that chetan bhagats books are largest selling books in india.
As the name says and the cover depicts that this book is dealing with two people from different states, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. Despite of variety and the uniqueness in their culture, their love unites their families, even though they used to be like rivalries of one another before. Love doesn't know boundaries and this book describes that fact clearly. Kudos to Mr. Bhagat for that. Interesting book. Made me smile many-a-times during my period of reading. It was a pleasure reading this book, and knowing the typical Indian mentality of the elders especially when it comes to marriage. Great book. Great author. Try out all of his collections. You all would surely love it.
KINDA good book has a good story,it attracts u to read it. but story travelles a lot in this nove like first they were in college tthen delhi then chennai then lastc again delhi.. the krish going to baba is all pure comedy.aarti going to marriage and doing a epic drama is alll very pure comedy. but TOTALLY 3/5.
2 States is an appropriate title given to this book. The book is all about 2 people who are from different states, who are in love with each other and wants to get married. As they are from different states their parents did not approve for their marriage. Krish and Ananya decides (name of the characters) to convince each others parents for their marriage. The story revolves around how orthodox people are there in India who do not allow people from 2 different castes to get married. After an year long drama both manages to convince their parents for their marriage. Over all an amazing novel to read....
This book was my first read ever. Never did I read a novel before nor did I think that I would ever read one. I always thought that reading cannot be fun, and considered myself lazy to go through so many pages. Finally, my sister brought it upon me that I should read a Chetan Bhagat's and suggested that I buy from Flipkart. I obliged, and am glad now that I did. Time was zipping past me when I was reading the book. I found it thoroughly entertaining, and the narrating was very gripping. No two consecutive pages in the book did I find boring. After this, i've already ordered 3 more books from Flipkart, who are doing a great job. All in all, a lovely entertainer.
Flipkart sevrices is always good. i got this book my three days from booking date. This Book is great it's explain how life is well if u want. Chetan Bhagat always wrote great books.I like this book. This story is about Chetan Bhagat's Life. This novel containts love,college,work,marriage.
Average by Chetan Bhagat's standards or has he run dry of ideas? While the book makes you laugh and think I get the feel that he us no repeating himself writing in the overcrowded genre. It was good when he was the only one but he needs to move on. A good book, nevertheless. If you haven't read any of his earlier books grab a copy.
I just re-read it. Its still one of the best books till date. I can realte to it with the marriage of my close friend. Plus the humour which is used in the book is amazing. The book may be biographical but even converting a biograpghy to a story is an art which only Chetan Bhagat can do.
its a very nice novel..... and i enjoyed reading the book.... well done chetan bhagat.. this novel is far much better than revolution 2020.. and the best thing about chetan bhagat's novels is that you get connected with the story and you start imagining the characters and the situations... i loved it.. worth reading..must read it....
You cant put it down..... Amazing book...... heart touching story......... beautiful ending....... by an absolutely GREAT writer........... If u have not buy it...... go ahead but it...... an awesome story is waiting for u..........
An interesting, easy and captivating read that will keep you glued. Characters are very real and you can easily connect with them. The book aptly expresses the real difference in cultures and how it gets between different generations when it comes to love marriage. But like most of the love stories the fight is worth it. A must read and a grateful insight to two different cultures.
I purchased the book from railway station and started reading as I started from Kolkata. The plot was so interesting that it kept my eyes stuck to the book till I finished reading it before reaching Mumbai. The way author has sarcastically screwed Citibank was amazing. The Goa scene where the protagonist tries to managing things in his favor was amazing. Chetan Bhagat is a real entertainer. Looking forward for a movie on this novel.
this time cb take upon reality i guess....the book takes upon the most toked abt thing in india.."marriage".. its beautifullly..wud tickle ur funny bone in spaces and throw limelight on matters in a humouruos way.... chetan lives upto mark once again....
This book is well written and I couldn't stop reading when I started. The story is funny and enticing. Anyone who is from North or South India could easily relate to the various situations and reactions mentioned in the story. I enjoyed reading this book to the fullest.. strongly recommended...
Well, i had heard good things about this book and that is when i finally decided to buy it It started a bit slow and i was always trying to mentally compare it to "5 point someone" so i was initially a little disappointed but Boy, did i know what was coming up next, as chapters passed i got so much into the storyline that i did not even have track of time and read the book through the night to finish it The key points that i liked is 1. Simple and lively language 2. A potent mixture of humor and satire made on the cultures and the practices being followed in each state 3. The chemistry between the lead characters 4. And the surprise element, some cross reference to his character in his first book, felt like a sequel and it felt good This is highly recommended from my side and please dont try and compare it to any classics, try reading it with a clean slate and you will have a smile on your face by the time you are done with this book Happy Reading
It's a nice story and I completed it in one go. Now I'm revising it. It's written in very simple language which makes everyone to understand and most of the time u keep smiling when u read some jokes . I will recommend this book ........ It is a worth for money.........
I would rate Two States above Five Point Someone and One Night at Call Centre. The story is funny, enticing, engrossing and Chetan's one liners provide the laughs throuout. Anyone who is from North or South India could easily relate to the various situations and reactions mentioned in the story. I finished the book at one go. A sincere bollywood movie would do this masterpiece a great justice. A feel good book. I read it whenever I get depressed. Two States will make you smile even in dire circumstances. GO FOR IT, YOU WON'T FIND A BETTER BOOK ON CULTURAL DIVIDE.
Really heart touching story.an interesting one.Specially if you are in love you will really like it because it showed how two people madly in love managed to get over all the obstacles in their marriage and finally got married.
This was the first book i read,and ofcourse it is the best one of all novels which i had read until now.chethan bhagath,who is most renowned name in writing novels narrates in his own life story with humour and romance.i surely suggest this book to be read by sure.. TQ :)
I simply fell in love with this novel..Its an amazing mixture of emotions,love,comedy,suspense & so much more! Its something that makes you feel rejuvinated when u finish it.. It is a must read again and again and again! :D All the readers who are in a relationship,THIS NOvEL WILL TEACH U A LOT ;)
I left this book mid way.. it is just usual masala Hindi movie script..same old and stale wine... two people from different backgrounds are in love with each other and how they get married despite resistance from families..Chetan please raise your standards for god's sake.
The story and the presentation is pretty awesome. From IIM A to Delhi to Chennai to Goa to Chennai and finally to tie the knot of marriage... Ananaya is too cute to resist love. A True Love Story... A treat for Reading Freaks...
hi iam not a big fan of chetan bhagat or any write i usually dont like to read. I purchased this book because of some great reviews about this book and also be honest because of its price as its price is not that too high. I got it yesterday in the morning and thanks to flipkart for there awesome delivery. I got the product in two days through bluedart. I read it and its so interesting to read the book that i almost completed hundered pages in one day. so, the bottom line is the book is awesome in all aspect its written in very simple language which make everyone to understand and most of the time u keep smiling when u read some jokes which happen in writer life. its worth to buy this book.Thank u
well written.. 5 stars ..beautifully expressed all the feelings and all the relations.. how to manage things everything is jusssst awwwwesome.. couldn't stop reading when i started..read all your novels chetan ji.. you are doing great job
This is about the love between a punjabi boy and a tamilian girl and their struggle to get married after convincing both their families. Story narration is interesting. Actually it's better than earlier chetan bhagat's novel's.It shows the difference between cultures and people's perspectives of south and north India in a funny realistic way
I must say that this book is the so far best work of Chetan Bhagat not only for the story but also the way he tells the story. I love the way he writes the book. I demand from Bhagat more books like this.
its very nice story , from previous reviews u might got the what book s all about , but the more nice thing abt the book is the detailing abt two unic culture. very awesome to read as a continuation of hari from 5 point sm1. also the book makes u too laugh and smile always , sometime makes u emotional too ,must read a motivational love story of two states boy n girl
its best love and romantic book we can say 5stars out of 5. best book among the books i read.................. indian style writing is another add point. more than anything its a true story based........
Fantastic love story !!!! first time ever in my life i was so anxious to read something and that too a love story. all the characters are so natural that the entire story moves around you. hats off to you man, the best example of national integrity. You Rock Chetan..
No doubt, Chetan Bhagat has imporved a lot from his previous book.. The writing style, choice of words, flow, speed.. everything has matured.. A book is not judged by the story. Its the art of story telling which makes a great book. I liked reading it. Hope you would like it too.. I heard people saying that it was too dramatic. It is but then, whats wrong with being dramatic. Its a full time pass - value for money.
After Two point someone everybody expected chetan to do wonders with his every outing. a night at call center dissapointed many. but he came back with three mistakes... The 2 states is a step ahead. very intriguing novel. excellent chracterisation, exceedingly well written and a page turner. chetan explores the diversified india excellently with his chracters. a definite buy for the chetan fans
BEST OF CB'S WORK AND VERY EMOTIONAL.I HATED KRISH'S FATHER IN 1ST 200 PAGES BUT ITS AMAZING WHAT HE DID FOR HIS SON IN LAST 20 PAGES.I READ THE BOOK 2 TIMES AND I WANT TO GIVE THE RATING 6 OUTOFF 5.I CRIED WHEN I SAW THAT ANANYA TOLD KRISH "ITS OVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME".FINALLY ITS HAPPY ENDING AND GOOD MOVE FROM CB TO INTRODUCE HIS FATHER IN CHENNAI.JUST SUPERB NOVEL.
Dis is one of d Chetan bhagats best book....u can't take ur hands off...if u start it u will end it in 4 hrs...awesum...specially d character of his mom is best...must read...Chetan bhagat best book after 5.1
I am a real diehard fan of ChetanBhagat. He is my favorite writer. His books are my favorite.. "2states" the most favorite of them all.. 2States is one of the best love stories I have ever heard or read about. A real transpiring love story.. I read the book in one nonstop sitting. Completed reading it for the eighth time now and I've never got bored reading it.. The book is an eye opener for young minds.For someone who thought the journey from start of 'true love' towards tying the knot was easy,the first three quarters of the book will frighten you.It depends on the way you see it thoughâ€¦.Last time I checked the novel has a happy ending so it should be fine guys.. Favorite line from the book; â€œPretty girls behave best when you ignore them. Of course, they have to know you are ignoring them, for otherwise they may not even know you exist.â€� NOTE: The book is a really inspiring one.. Girls who are a bit shy and who think they will never fall in love with someone of the other caste or religion, may be fearing from some really strong resistance from their families (ie. every typical Indian girl) should not read this book.. They might get encouraged and may even fall in love!! I've got a second hand experience.. :D
I always feel like calling Chetan bhai for his stories make me feel so Indian. I love the story in each every page that as Tamilian girl enjoyed more. I like the way you represent each and every Indian custom and culture.
Afer reading Chetan's previous books like 'One Night @ The Call Center' & 'Five Point Someone', I was eagerly waiting to grab this book. Yes, it is a masterpiece work from Mr.Bhagat. I've finished reading this book in just 3 days. What I like in this novel is Chetan's narrative-style about two families & their culture, One from Punjab and another one from South. Awesome work Chetan, Looking forward to read more interesting novels from Chetan Bhagat. Kudos to him :)
This is the best book of all the books written by CB. Interesting & realistic approach, you will not be able to stop reading somewhere in between. While reading one would be able to connect their life to the novel that is what makes this novel special. And description of all fine details in details makes the book more interesting. I am reading it over and over... Loving itttttttttttt
my girlfriend recommended mee this book....im although a big cb fan,.but there is something different in this book,the kind of darkish humour he has used in it .....binds u up till the last line of the last page ...and the prologue part is just damn catchy ....strongly recommended as it contains so much reality ....
This was the first novel which i read in my life.. And i got this novel from one of friend. This book created a bridge of communication between me n her. Got closed and finaly v r in a relationship.. Even i too had a true love story from this book.. Its doesn't only makee u feel the situations explained in this book it also makes u to feel to love someone in ur life.. Thanks CHETHAN BHAGATH..
I missed to read this one as I was busy with my new mother role. :) While reading now, my daughter also observed that mama is laughing and even getting sad some times...Now even she makes faces holding the book opened. Well I read it 1 day the entire night with out realising its 5 AM in the morning now! (realized it after hearing birds chirping.... Really an excellent narration.
Story is awesome ...... starts very nicely..espically the college story ..in mid when krish came back to delhi ..the story baecame litle slow ...but the krish's father accepted the marrige. The story baegins again . Overall A good love story...
Good and interesting.. Story building in early 100 pgs and then the fun part starts. Ending is unpredictable and thus catches more interest. I loved reading this book. U might like this book if you have fallen in love and have tried to do things to make situation better for both the families.
Awesome love story by Chetan Bhagat. You will feel like watching a typical bollywood movie- full of drama, emotions... You will travel from Delhi to Chennai and come to know about various South Indian dishes. :-) A must read for all lovers!
I smiled at almost all pages of this book. It perfectly explains what happens when a boy and girl from 2 different states want to get together in a marriage, how parents react, the differences in practices/ habit, etc. Tamil Brahmin men are glued to the Hindu newspaper, their family get-togethers are very quiet in comparison to the vibrant and colourful Punjabi equivalents - How True!! The girl could have been depicted in a more dignified and decent manner.
one of the sweetest love story ever... Mr.chetan... i'm simply amazed at all your books.... i've read everything. all the books are fantastic.. i'll rate '2 states',the best book of all the other ones by you.. i love ananya... :)
very good read, excellent attempt Chetan Bhagat is really good.Story is close to everybody's heart. will never let you get bore......very realistic and must read. Very well written good humor and never felt like leaving it for a single moment. Now I am a real fan of Mr.Chetan Bhagat.
One of the best book to read .....friends this is a perfect book to read, well written and perfectly one of the best story which I wish i could have in my life....Chetan Bhagat is Awesome. I would Like to Thanks Flipkar for its quick delivery.
This book is one of the best love story that i have read, I have read it in 5 hours,the different things that in life the partners need to go through is classified in very good manner by chetan, This book is the best book written by chetan, I suggest that everybody should read this book,Chetan you rocks......
This Book, I First Read At My School Library. Although I Just Read Mere 10 Pages, I Loved It. I Issued It The Same Day. Reading It Is So Much Fun And Aspiring For IIMA Aspirants As IT Gives A Peep Into The Life OF An IIMAian. Also The Bhagat Has Efficiently Brought Forward The Message Of InterState Marriages And The Dowry System. This Book Is Really The Book For The Modern India.
Its an interesting story by Chetan Bhagat that how we Indians respect one anothers customs, culture etc. for the shake of true love. It shows how the father loves his son besides his adament nature and this indicates that without elders support, the successes in love or marriage is not possible. Any how thanks to writer.
i had already read CB's previous books...... was waiting for this one.... a month after the launch i got the book... i started reading at 7 at evening... i forgot dinner.... finished at 3 in the morning... couldn't sleep then... for the next whole month i was stuck... i was not able to think about anything else but the story..... standing ovation to Chetan...... excellent narration... well i am in love with the characters and story......
One of the sweetest and finest love story... :)" I read this book while i was travelling and whole book I finished during my transit at Russia (airport)... I spend 6 hours both the time and I still amazed how those 12 hours gone... superrrrrrrrr likee....
i must say that i have never laughed so much while reading a book as i have laughed reading this book.no matter they r making a film adaptation of this book.chetan has done a good job in apturing the moods of punjabis as well as tamiliansthe writing is simple and one feels as if one is reading a script.nevertheless a good buy though the character of Ananya could have been more indianised rather than her portrayal.good read!
tHE best book so far by Chetan Bhagat..It shows even Management graduates can love beside thinking about profit and thts y Chetan Bhagat is different.Finished it in one go long ago.Felt like writting the comment after I got dissapointed after reading Revolution 20-20...no story vogus name..
Considering this was published in 2009, i am mad with myself that i did not come across this absolute gem earlier.. For people who know what love means...this book is simply a eloquently fulfilling conversation with one's own self. I read this book at one stretch the first time in under 3 hours and have lost count on how many times i have read this since then.. This story is precisely the story of modern indian love marriages..with emotions of all kinds...especially the flourishing finale... Please give us much much more....even though i know that miracles do not happen twice consistently...but faith makes things possible..as it happens in Two States.....
full to indian story...it has everything in it. book is well written..typical bhagat style. it has all the melo drama scene a girl or boy faces at the time of marriage, especially in case of love marriage..i enjoed reading this book to the fullest.. strongly recommended...
Some friend suggested me and I brought for actual price( with no discount as i had some gift coupon) . Boy it turned out to be disastrous . Stupid book and very very boring. Its a mystery how i was able to complete reading such a bad book. I am surprised how the Chetan Bhagat books are getting sold . He write stuff which has nothing. No moral , No storyline, Not even some good English . Wish i could vote a big big Zero. But will rate 1 As its the lowest.
Amazing. Hilarious. Simple. Very very identifiable. Highly recommended by my better half and myself (In fact she'd told me its a wonderful read!). 2 States is an honest story with a soulful rendition, and it bleeds reality. Chetan Bhagat's best by far.
Awesome Book.. While many love story books just go like a day dream.. Chetan's book take a different route. He makes love story look practical and some what a cute and beautiful one.. Even the readers tend to love after reading this book..
its just an awesome story i wish i had the same story as krish nd annaya had........ they are just awesome ther studies ther interview evrythng is just beyond imagination...... no one in this world can be so strong nd united to show ther true love nd affection towards each other
2 states I think best book by chetan bhagat, it has his full style of fun and entertainment and also it looks more mature. it truely satisfies you, it's more dramatic, more technical, and a little more sensational than his previous works. a fruitful read.
I would rate this one as CB's best work till date. 2 States is fun, fact, enriching and entertaining in every aspect. This book has the potential to be made in a typical bollywood blockbuster. A love story with regional tadka - a Punjabi and a Madrasan - cannot get better. It is in one word 'unputdownable' and watch out for some CB styled humor in everyday situations. Must read.
CB gives his own experiences about the inter state marriage in India. It is a mixture of humour and love by clearly looking at the extremes of traditional Indian families and their misconceptions about marriage. Good read.!
Awesome!! This is all I can say....!! After 5 Point Someone, this is the BEST by CB but I seem to like this one more :) Page 111 and Superb!! CB, You got a new fan. Thanks for bringing out this Masterpiece. Desperate to complete the book and then re-read it :)
Good job Chetan again... I read the book in one go...It really keep me hooked to the characters and there was no dull moment...I really loved the character of Krish's mother. I was unable to control my laughter with her sarcastic attitude and constant taunting. You can keep on reading this book again and again especially for young readers...
personally I think now Chetan Bhagat writes a book ,he writes by estimating commerciality and it's credibility as an hindi movie.... Book's got a good sense of humour but in last while reading I felt like story's too good to be someone's real life story means, how he wins over his laws and esp. his mother in law , it feels fake ! I'll say go for it , small read and while reading keep in mind, you'r reading script of movie to be made ! have fun
well wot to say...Chetan Bhagat has always been a great writer for me startin from his 'Five point some one'....this book is really awesum...while readin u wil start thinkin of ur bf/gf(if u have)....lovelovelovelovelove
gr8 this was my 1st novel it made me smile laugh cry scene here is so nicely depicted that it wins ur heart.. gud book every 1 should have.. i don't knw how to express my views about this book.. but, yeah.. it is an outstanding book... awesome work by Mr.Chetan Bhagat..
read nothing like dis (seen only in movies),d way he builds up nd presents it is bind blowing.cheese lines,thrilling plots,sweet dialogues.u really become a part of it.everything is jst good.d cover page to d price,narration to the presentation.best of series
Must read for all especially Gen-X and Y. Very nicely portrayed the minutest details. However, some things like mother-in-law made star by allowing her to sing with Hariharan, is little out of the world thinking. But overall very very nice.
I don't want to waste a lot of time about writing for this book, but all I can say is it is a complete waste of time for readers who love good books with good storyline, this book might be appreciated by the school teens or early college hoppers but for an experienced reader it is all crap unlike other good work of Chetan Bhagat. The book has unnecessary slapstick comedy stolen from some movies and deliberately drawn incidents to create a good catchy scene which is apparent but it drifts from a good story subject which is missing hugely in the book. Oodles of unnecessary sex for all the teens... but not a good book.. as I find it.
One of the best book i read out of 4. One of my friend visited from singapore during the release of 2 States and i was thinking what shall i give her as return gift. Later i thought lets give her 2 states as it depicts the Indian Marraige & love story too. She was bit surprised on the return gift that i gave. She read the same 1 day before leaving to singapore and loved the book very one. To my surprise, she informed that she loved the book so much that she even purchased the copy of other 3. Great Book and nice write-up.
This is the first text I ever ordered from Flipkart. The service was great and so was the product. As war as the contextual elements of the text is concerned, I think Chetan Bhagat does a fairly good job here. He is witty, he is slapstic at times, yet he unearthes the nuances of the 'marriage market' in India today with panache and chutzpah. His portrayal of the idiosyncrasies of South and North India is witty and yet thought provoking. This is not a 'heavy literature' and the language is for everyone to understand. It is a good time pass read for everyone.
Chetan Bhagat potrayed a perfect pen picture by this story.Act 1 is the best part and the last part of the story explained about the father who wants to give a best life for his son is heart touching even though tough relationship exist between them.All of the whole a nice love story.
There is nothing to excite about this novel.Poor description and ideas about "Madrasi" people.If people praise chetan Bhagat as a best novelist and his work as great then I regret for them because they havent tasted the best stories , novels and literature yet
gr8 this was my 1st novel it made me smile laugh cry scene here is so nicely depicted that it wins ur heart.. gud book every 1 should have 1 nice service by flipkart
novel was written in a good rhythmic tempo and pace was good.Although sometimes it feels very filmy kind of item,taking u to love-society-parents trio problem.Still it was good one after Five Point someone
When i read the book i was feeling like a movie goin on in my mind...its a good book to read especially if you are into some love affair or out of it and like romantic stories...
I have been reading the book.. if i have started to reading the episodse in the book could not have mind to stop the page and its been interesting to see what else next. The actual timepass and characters in the book are amazing that could be seen in the typical indian family and their culture. I had love marriage mostly the situations narrated between krish and ananya life reminded to depict my life. Thanks to author. One small demerit of the author side - But in chetan Bhagat author's book does not motivate me to repeat the reading subsequently.
I don't know why the crappy writers are downgrading the standard of literary world. Chetan Bhagat's books are as cheap their prices. A high school student can write better prose than him.
i read many novels, but this was the best of them.i love to read novel. i am very sad when i finished this book. i want to read more n more.
A friend of mine has given me this book just two days back...i hve finished almost half of it inspite of my busy schedule...i m in a relationship like Krish and Ananya....most of the time I lost myself in the story...but i started loving krish more than my boyfriend for what he did for Ananya. I wish if my boyfriend can do a few things what krish did...thn only our love story can succeed...thanks to Chetan Bhagat
This is the first time, I'm reading book of Chetan...really interesting book. I read the book in just 6 hours..Impressive work done by Chetan..IIMA. I suggest all others who are just starters in reading, can just go with this. Heading back to Flipkart.com. You guys are great in delivering books interns of quality and overnight shipping. Simply I can Just say..WOOOW..
for beginners,its d best book.u must fall in love as well as book also chetan bhagat after completing this.. so go 4 it....
am totally flattered after read dis superd novel,,,da way its described zz speechlesss,,,am da biggest fan tooo....May GOD bless u olwze
Humourous, Interesting and Fast paced- This is what a reader expects from a comedy novel. Well this book got it all. Once you buy it you won't regret it. It is the story of a Punjabi boy Krish, who falls in love with a South Indian girl, Ananya. They want to get married but thier families disagree. They impress each other's families and convince them to accept the relationship with humourous results, forms the rest of the story. I recommend this to everyone who has a knowledge of Indian culture. An enjoyable read. Read once, you will read again!!
excellent book. every youngster must read it. 4.5 stars out of 5.
I'm 21 years old and this is the first book in my LIFE I completely read by involving and live in it imagining that it was my life.... Awesome...... Thank you CHETHAN sir.....
This is a book for timepass.Well not even timepass, I read it in 2 days, it is not for childeren and and not also teens under 16 as far as I think.This book is having some bad words which I think should not be used in reading books.
TWO STATES is a book supposedly inspired from Bhagats own life,It is entirely not real as there are spasms of FICTION.The undercurrent message the book spells out in the first few pages are TIMEPASS,it is an attempt to bring the humour of a realationship taking both parts of India and yet again comparing the similarities and differences.For those who are real BHAGAT fans and liked 5.someone or 3 mistakes....... this will provide for ample read,this book is not a masterpiece but will pass;)
Received the order within 1 Business days. What more can i say . Great job Flipkart. The delivery guys were very professional too. So in a nutshell thanks u guys :)
i got to read this book after my board exams... it proved to be a perfect for tonic for my nerves to unscrew itself... Mr. Bhagat truly captures the mind of almost every young indian guy.... when i completed this book i felt like a changed guy full of energy n compassion to do the most impossible tasks in my future. Adding to it Ananya being my first ever crush in my schooling days made reading this book an exciting one :P
this is a very nice book by chetan bhagat. i am really impressed with the service of flipkart.i personally recommand this site as best buying site.nobody can get this book at such a low price.flipkart rockssssss.
Its worst fiction book I have ever read in this everything is predictable from start till dead end. I read novels so that I dont know what is going to happen in next step,I wud be knowing nothing about future of story but It was totally opposite in here. I wud say total waste of time & money(its my review of the book) but Chetan's first 3 books r good to read. 2 states is 1 out of 5 rating book(its just my rating). Bought it read it dint like it lost it!
It's the best of chetan bhagat's novels as yet. Not many characters in the plot but its good
The way Chetan has boldly written down is amazing. There is not a second when you willo feel bored. You will surely want to finish this book off before the other books you may be reading
Spicy enough to make you flip through the pages.....and Mr. Bhagat has the art of making things visualize.
I felt it was a story of some in real life doing everything possible to get love of her life The story connects so well. Awesome Book.....finished it in 2 days
great book.... just cant stop reading it.. wonderful..
took me 6 days to complete.. ofcourse i am a really slow reader.. there are lots of ppl who completed it in just 5hrs!!! it just showed a vivid picture of the average indians.. and i totally enjoyed the read... entertaining enough... worth a read one...
friends this is a must read book..... it cool & n who would know the youth better than chetan bhagat.....
I feel it is good to read "2 States" just for timepass. I am sure there are lots of people out there who are in love with people in different states and with different culture but the marriage could not happen because of the orthodox thought of the family and hence results in breakup. And your girlfriend end up marrying some body's boyfriend and you end up marrying some body's girlfriend. Even if we are educated I cannot understand this phenomenon. If you don't have guts to face your parents and not able to convince them then just don't make any love relationship. At least in this story, the marriage happens all due to their convincing ability and understanding and educating their parents' and people.
i read the book in a couple of days!! and im not a vivid reader... that explains it....!
Pulp for the masses !! This book is littered with every known cliche that you've heard about north indians and south indians known to mankind. It's more bollywood script and less of literature. Read it if you want to pass off four hours laughing at old tamil punjabi jokes, if you are looking for something more serious and insightful stay away
Chetan Bhagat has outdone himself!..by far i found 5 point something to be his most compelling read...but 2 states has gone par the level bhagat set for himself. The story of his love,his college, his fight for the love of his life, undying hope, trip into depression and finally his marraige is the story that many indians would relate to.The book has a perfect balance of side-splitting humor, tear producing emotions and a true indian feel to it. It makes an amazing read not once but many times over.Bhagat's knack of moulding the story from 1 scene to other with perfect transitionary elements makes me rank the book 5/5. A must read!
This is the second Chetan Bhagat book that I have read ( the first being the hugely popular 5 pt..). I'm a southindian married to a maharashtrian, so I could relate to parts of the novel, but just like most creative things indian, the second half was a complete mess and the book really got annoying by the end. The discounted price is about all one should pay-up for this book.
i read the book 2 times. but still couldnt like it. some areas of the story r really boring . some r highly intresting too but i just want to say that chetan bhagat is improving and one day will write a good book....
completely a waste of time n waste of money..gave me a headache
very ver good book
a witty and comically narrated story of an inter-caste marriage between a south-indian and a punjabi. chetan bhagat has gone into the micro details which is what makes the book as much fun to read as it is. but i must add, i enjoyed it more by virtue of being a south-indian in an inter-caste marriage myself. if you're one of the people in my situations, this is a must read for you!
I think, it is the best of all his earlier three books. Perfect mixture of two cultures : Punjabi and Tamilian. Remarks on both the cultures make the book really interesting. Wedding episode is very homorous. Apart from all this, it gives the message that we all are INDIAN first after that we are PUNJABI, TAMILIAN etc. One more thing, i liked the show of love by Krish father in the end , Afterall father cann't be too bad for his son. Moreover,the way of presenting thoughts and scenes of Chetan Bhagat as usual is marvellous So, in crux, it is really very good book. MUST READ IT.
Writing a long tiring review isn't necessary. I believe this is one should not be missed at any cost. Humour,drama,relations.. everything in one small package.
I am not an avid book reader and never read any book for six hours straight.....not even for my engg exams......Its a nice read ....... but i felt that some parts of the book was kind of a bollywood flick.... :-) ... Anyway i enjoyed the six hours.... A very nice message to all the INDIANs........
This is the 1st ever book i bot frm flipkart, and my first book outsid academics. Wow the xprience is gr8, i strtd readin it casually and more bcos i spent cash.... page aftr page it jus glued my eyes to read,,, which i am used oly to watchin movies...it has all elements of an entertainer on bwood terms....th author's expression of humor is super-effortless and a 'common man' can easily relate to any incident in this....its a "funny-thriller" the term more associated with romantic comedies....
When it comes to the writing of Chetan Bhagat, readers are never disappointed. Same is the case about his latest novel '2 States'. Captivating and humorous story about two lovers who belong to two different worlds and fight for their love. The story flows well till the end...
The novel story is very simple and heart touching. I don't know 2 states book , when i heard from my sister this book name and purchased book and started to read. it gives a message to all the Indians on national integrity. First i red 5 Points 4 someone and Second 2 states. Very Very thank to CRETAN BHAGAT..............................for giving Exellent books to the new generation. Sir becouse of Your Novel lot of Students strated to read Novels .... Thank You Once Again..............
I have read the book once .......I really liked the way Chetan have written it out.... Every single thing have been explained so nicely.... The story is amazing............ & truly true ............ Chetan rockzzzzzzzzzzz........
good book common story but interesting n funny writing liked it
This was the first book of CB that I have just finished. A mustr read for all who want to know the Punjabi culture as I do not know much about the Tamilians. But the depiction of Tamilians resembles, what we see around in our official life. The message in the book is loud and clear that ultimately we all are INDIANS
I think its one of the best novels i hav ever read. The story is interesting and u get hooked till you finish the book. I recomend everyone to read it.
hey its a nice book. I completed it very quickly ending was quite predictive like hindi movie else book was fun
I've read all his books and this comes as a relief after the "3 mistakes of my life" disaster. The best part is the narration. Chetan Bhagat great strength is how his character narrates and of course the Comic timing was perfect like in Five point Someone. The Love story is cute like his other books. Would have made a classic if the bollywood hang over was avoided but then it may not be as much fun too...
The novel is awesome.The story is simple,writing is excellent with beautiful and funny one liners.This is certainly one of best books of Chetan Bhagat.The people who didn't like it try Ravinder Singh's "I too had a love story",may be you deserve that.
As I went by reading it or rather imersing in it,tears of satisfaction rolled down my eyes... My sweet heart came in front of my soulful eyes... I love this book as it makes me remember of him & therefore its "THE BEST..." READ IT FOR SURE AS IT WILL MAKE U REMEMBER OF UR LOVE TOOO...
this buk is xtermly gud!!!!!!!! espescially fr da lovers who r so depressd wid luv failure this lso in 1 way shows ur respect towards ur parents!!!!!!!! intresting one!shld surely hava luk at dis buk!
A really nice book.... I finished it in just 6 hrs...!!!! this is not only a book but it also show the people in love that if your love is true then even society problems are not strong enough to compel you to Step Back...!!! Good work Keep It Up...!!!
Simple, straight and heart-touching .... I am from Rajasthan and residing n Chennai. For the section Chennai - Almost every second line I refer to the situations around me and just thinking how came possible - what a coincidence ... Read twice and may read again ... Recommended : Yes for a good hearthy laugh .. Best from Chetan
The Writer really feel his love and written this story... Its Really supper... when ever i feel my love that time i read this book... he is remain every movement of love... Thanks Thanks lot to Chetan bhagat for given this book...
For someone who never liked reading it was a cream. Chetan Bhagat might not be @ the best of English as you say, however he is definately @ the bulls eye when it comes to Indian Mentality, He is definately a good writer in his own way. M a huge fan and appreciates his literature.
Chetan has interestingly woven his love story into this novel, and considering the low price tag, the 4 to 5 hours read is not a bad deal. An exaggerated paper version of DDLJ, with the tadkas of caste and regionalism, thats what i feel. He inspires the love birds, attempt to pacify the families rather than eloping out instantly...a three star rating
Hi, Bought this book at the Airport (Sorry Flipkart), and thanks to flight delays. I was able to complete the book in my return trip. I will say the booked lived up to my expectations from Chetan. While going thru it there were many moments that let me into a laugh and people around ended up looking at me. while I think towards the end I felt it is bit dragged but I will always recommend this one. Simple and straight from heart. Kamal.
Don't judge a book my it's cover - heard that before? Well just don't judge this review by it's title. That was just a side thought but definitely attractive enough to grab your eyeball! This is another page turner from the Bhagat Factory. Exploring the vagaries of two quite different cultures, it offers a great insight into a not-so-typical Indian marriage setup. Most books about Indian marriages would dwell more on rubbishing the system of arranged marriages. A refreshing take on a love marriage between a Punjabi guy and Tamil girl, the book definitely will score with most youngsters since they will be able to associate with either protagonist directly through themselves or through some hindi movie character. The book, at times, is genuinely funny. I was reading it on a flight and I had to actually cover my face with the book to mask my laughter. It also got quite descriptive in matters of sex, unlike Five Point Someone. Also, there were some well-placed links in this book to facts from Five Point Someone (FPS). But "Krish" from 2 States reminiscing "Hari" from FPS was quite interesting. Just like FPS, I read this book pretty much at one go. Very light reading, some scenes towards the end seem tailor made for a bollywood setup. Perhaps it's time Chetan stopped merely providing inspiration to hindi movie makers and got down to writing scripts / directing.
i have gone through all his books among it' 2 states' is the best coz it deeply disect and analysed indian[not only indian all the south asian mind set] mind set. yes, some events and plot looks like dramatic but it is reality in our south asian culture.messege of book is clear and loud that is''' love is unconditional, beyound any boundry set by culture'' i love this book and recomend read this book before someone make it movie coz three idiots killed soul of ' five point someone'.
Chetan has good narrative skill; he brings the characters live and make the reader to involve in the story. Nice book to understand the culture of two states. He should have avoided the racial specific narration, especially about Tamalians. Accepting in broad mind, must read book.
I like his book a lot...really youngstars like his books like mad...he has lots of dare cause he has written so many personal things about himself and her wife in that book...i appreciate his dare...hats off to you sir
The novel is ok for timepass.Simple language accompanied with small volume makes this novel a great choice for travellers.I will take just 2 days to complete the novel.Just like the feel you get after watching a SRK film.But even in this masala bollywood novel there are still places to be improved. The story is elaborate with his experience in Chennai but when it comes to the lead lady visitning punjab we can cover the whole Punjab epic in 1 chapter.The author must have been in a hurry to wind up his work.
I am done with the 2 states book and find it an interesting love story with an happy ending. I liked the message that it spreads via it, a way to have harmony in nation. Interstate marriages are really the great way to get rid of the tradition, Custom, rituals etc and to build a fraternity feeling among all. This Book did a great job to Prove the concept of "Unity in Diversity".
Really its fair and direct. every info s posted gud and fun.this book helps the people who loved from different religions, castes, areas, countryes.after reading this i think so they can manage their parents. Bcoz i'm facing this problem (different caste)with my loved one parents Thank Q chetan .
The book is â€˜Vertical Integrationâ€™ of India in which both the ends (North & South) of India are not spared by Chetan. The book is simple, straight forward n bit witty..... nice & fun to read. So just Enjoy it !!
I don't know what people liked in this Novel but of course, if it related to somebody's life then surely they are gonna to love it.. When I came to know that Chetan.. New Novel has lauched. I immediately went to the shop and purchased as his last Novel ..
I don't know what people liked in this Novel but of course, if it related to somebody's life then surely they are gonna to love it.. When I came to know that Chetan.. New Novel has lauched. I immediately went to the shop and purchased as his last Novel .. Three Mistakes of My Life has left a very good impact on my mind. I loved his 3 Mistakes of my Life. It was lesson for life. but comparing his this Novel. I do not know what to say.. My expectation was sky high and this Novel has brought right on the down.. I didn't feel like to read it at all.. It is not all worth reading as per my experience.. I didn't even Complete it.. well.. leave it.... this time I don't think he blasted like the other three Novels... Those Novels were good.., Specially 3 Mistake of my life.. I hope .... he will come back soon with his new one and will leave a outstanding mark again.. Best of luck ahead ...... Chetan Sir.. You are the best and Best always gives outstanding expectation..
Hey Chetan.. As usual this time also you have proved yourself.. I have read all your novels.. This novel is as good as your first novel Five point someone.. Thanks for writing such entertaining novels for us.... Keep writing this way... Eagerly waiting for your next novel...
You will finish reading this book in 2 days because you will be very curious about the ending. but the book has written by keeping a bollywood movie in mind, The narration goes like that. If you want to watch movie once it is released do not read this book and if you want to read this book do not watch the movie once it is released.
I must say that this is the best novel written by Chetan. His privious books were not as per expection that he created by 'Five Point Someone.' But well done with 'Two States'. There is natural humour. The climax of this book is comparable to his first one. The book compels not to leave without finishing. Thanks Chetan. Keep it up for us.
M simply wonderstrucked!!! Youth story with a advanced effect. Itz a spicy blockbuster. Not missable under any circumstance! Hats Off 2 u Chetan 4 dis wndrful pce..
I have read all the books up to date. I have also read nobel winning authors. Love it or hate it. One thing's sure he has brought reading to the college students all over india. Introduced a lot of people to some literature in the queen's language. In short he did to indian youth what harry potter did to kids world over. cheers chetan!
Dear writer, I completed it in 8 consecutive hours (from 11:30pm-7:30 am).I have been preparing for CAT plus have a boyfriend from IIT-D (currently working in J.P. Morgan chase), who is a devil-may-care kindda and innocent (because least interested in girls and I career-focused) guy. A couple of things in your story and mine do match. Two things were bugging my mind like anything. first-will Iâ€™ll be in one of the IIMs, and second-will he ever grow up? Now it had to happened, I got to read it. Actually he had threatened me not to read it till I am done with CAT. Time for THE EXPERT'S COMMENTS (bad joke? I know)...as everyone in the country is aware it's a moving love story though common in story but outstanding in narration..(Actually things become common, how we can expect God to create a new story for everyone. Population Problem you see.)...Apart from my "non-jhelable jokesâ€�. I would like to adulate by saying "It was not just a love story but proved to me a motivational one, I started burning the midnight oils, and gird up my loins to make my dream come true(because i was really fascinated by the HALLMARK that you both possessed)..i even liked the blending of the flavor of 'united India' to it(since i am highly patriotic).. And now I am so relaxed, and have stated to myself like his mine love story will also be fine. I have sent him a copy of the novel. Along with that I sent a love letter too to do some coaxing work and how can I forget mentioning, I put some leaves of a branch that touches my balcony (like Ananya did. sorry no flowers available neither in my hair nor in my balcony)...Thanks for bearing another writer and for the 'ACTUAL REVITALS'...i destressed myself..
I was quite curious to read Chetan's latest novel which turned out to be only a good time pass. But the price of the novel is very reasonable. All the characters in the novel are very filmy and smells immature. Dialogues are punching. It can be made as a film which can become a hit entertainer in the hands of a right director. His novels are becoming stereotype with repetitions taken from his previous novels. He should try something different in his next novel so as to retain his regular readers.
Oh Man! What do i start from?This book has made me fall right away.What an excellent narration by CB.Love you dude,felt really REAL and frank.He did his best in those situations....and I love CITIBANK AND IIM-A now!
its a nice book.. like even i am a punjabi from delhi and in madurai.... and these auto drivers here really sucks...but some things in this book is undigestable... like how a son can hit his dad.... even i had have faced the same situation .. i had also stoped my DAD's hand once but no one can dare to hit his DAD... and one more thing i dnt get how come this family matter got resolved. how come his father got girl's address. and how come one can wear micky mouse on his marriage... ;) its really amazing book must read.... hey chetan please come up with some more books.. i use to complete ur books in one sit... have read ur all 4 books nearly 3 times each.. (old ones) and 2state 1c as really dnt get time... today i am sleepy as i have completed it yest night...
I had read his earlier book but unfortunately left them in between due to this or that problem ( Except Five point Someone). But this book of his right from first page aroused the curiosity and the story connected itself somewhere to me and my known one. It is sure that you will connect yourself somewhere or the other. It is surely wrriten on the social biasing of the society which every one of us is effected with this or that way round. His way of using the words is very curiositive. His Delhi/Chennal/Delhi and something something Krish something something is too funny, there are moments when it became too touchy and moments when u thing he is very bindas in creating masala but that's the way he writes. A must from my side, Every one should go for it , u are assured of worth your money and time.

hey its really a gr8 story yaar......... dnt go by d language...... i also started reading only with dis guy called chetan bhagat.... he is jst tooo good. one who dnt like to read him then its ok but dnt give him this types of comments......
Just toooooooooooo gooooooooooooood !!!! it has all the fun all the pleasures n so many movements we just enjoyed it throughout.... i wanna read it again.... as i did wid the last ones... just appreciable...
Indeed bets book....again chetan shows his power of writing for youth..good love story cum social drama. compare with other books this one is far better.must read for those who fall in love in transfer into marriage.
This book would be sold and purchased purely on the merits of the author's name. The first book 5 point someone was a good one and the idea to market it at just Rs 95 was a genius. And it helped a great deal that the book was a good read. All the books that followed cashed in on the hype of the first book but could not match the read quality of the first one. This latest one is the worst of the lot and although it would be a commercial success it, as per my humble opinion, was a total waste of money - even at Rs95. I'm disappointed because I was really looking forward for a good read. Would I recommend it: No Would I re-read it: No Would I gift it: Only if the gift can be anonymous.
Well, Is there any word limit of this small box to applause the stateful story the two States ?? Let it not be. What is a life with a bound !! I have never been welcomed by a book so engrossing, exuberant, emphatic and (m in short of words, in fact), in my life.Krish is amazing, a character deserves to be in iit and iim.. not jostling but having an accolade. A simple thing Krish (or Hari) always follow 'If you dont thing straight u r screwed'. Flashback - thats the magic of Chetan to literally Thanks to Chetan, for creating such a story that can alternately make and break your heart in successive happiness and ache. More than a novelist i should say you are a terrific storyteller. Chetan, One more whispering thing. Convey it to Krish.. South has not changed by a nanometer from the day he left ;)
I just completed Chetan's fresh book Two States. I loved the book after reading it The way he described every thing is out of this worls. The book is so humorous full of some fun filled some emotional some fighting n some happy moments.How a person can get involved with some one in love if some wants to know this than go and read it. you too will love it.. :)
Nice,writing novels is not a tough job, but like chetan, funtastic ! I remembered my love story when i was reading "One Night at the Call centre". Similarly rememberd my childhood while on readnig " Three Mistakes of my Life" But each story ends with good endings, In all cases it will not happen like me I failed to get my Priyanka(Neha), Thank u Chetan. For ur nice books.
Well being a Chetan Bhagat fan felt disappointed somewhere ........I guess it felt more like watching a hindi movie rather than reading a book ofcourse songs missing......... Kind off average book.
The beginning was quite entertaining but gradually when they left the IIMA, it becomes a quite boring which we have seen in hindi movies & soaps. It picked up pace and again it fall down as if there was something missing in Chetan's story which we usually find in his other books. The end was quite unexpected as krish family readily accept his "madrasi" counterpart and her family. I'll give it 3 out of 5.
Well Well another CB book and the downward graph continues............Its like DDLJ set in another world but the basic idea does not deviate. CB is a good writer but I guess he needs to get out of his comfort zone and try something new,the basic props he uses are getting tiresome. Hoping the next book is something he has not attempted till now.
I must say it is the best love story I have ever read. I mean nothing is very flowery and too good to imagine.Everything is as precise and meaningful as it can be.The humour in it is superb...Frankly speaking, i did not like One night @ the call center and 3 Mistakes of my life to a great extent. But 2 states has surpassed all the boundaries of my liking.I found it a better work when compared to 5 Point Someone.It may be because when i read 5 Point Someone, I was in my college goign through those days...so i liked it at that time.But currently, my position is like Ananya in the book. It is very important issue for me in comparison to college life.thats y i liked it even more. I am pretty sure all the lovers looking forward to a love marriage are going to like it.
HE IS A BEST NOVELLER SPECIALLY FOR YOUNGESTER.HE MAKE THE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT YOU U LIKE MAY BE IT WILL WRONG FOR THE WORLD.I JUST READ HIS ALL NOVEL,ITS AMAZING AND HOPE NEW COMING IS ALSO SUPERB
Such a Amazing Love Story. I could not Read this Book.But I heard something Good opinion About this Book.If YOu have money Just buy the book and Read Carefully ,Think How can u continue ur love and Get Love marriage .I Wish All Success to Lovers. Enjoy ur life through this book. "East And West" Chetan Bhagat is Best................"
I have read all the books of chetan released till date. I do find them interesting and enterntaining. But somewhere having read five point i feel that 2 states repeats some concepts , some issues and punches. I think chetan has tried to continue his previous book , but i guess would have been more happy to see a variation in writing to something different. Hope it comes up in his books to come. At 95 rs. its a cheap and entertaining time pass. PS : i dont find any message in the book , neither do i expect one though as pointed out by other people in thier reviews.
Beauty of Life comes in small thing...the same way Chetan's novels have captivated a whole new genre of readers..who have the power to transform our nation.His message is clear..the narrow boundaries of States should fall before India the Nation and ofcourse love proves the tool to do away with such ills..Yeah!!I loved this novel in that way...the tone of Chetan's novels always present the story frankly and reading novels about things of our own lyf truly stir our memories..both sweet and yeah..sad.But that's what is great about Chetan. My Final Judgement Dear Prospective Readers...JUST BUY THE BOOK..NO 2ND THOUGHTS.. To Chetan Sir::JUST GO ON ,MAKE US READ & THINK ,IAM SURE U WILL ONEDAY COME OUT WITH A MASTERPIECE THAT WILL SURELY CHANgE HOW WE THINK ABOUT INDIA..WAITING 4 THAT DAY WITH ALL MY HEART Dinnu
I WAS ON MY WAY BACK FROM MY WIFE'S PLACE IN DELHI TO KOLKATA, MY HOME TOWN. AT THE AIRPORT PICKED UP THE BOOK AFTER HEARING SOME RAVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE BOOK. ACTUALLY BEING MARRIED TO A GIRL FROM ANOTHER STATE THE BOOK DREW MY ATTENTION. GOING THROUGH THE BOOK IN ONE GO I WOULD LIKE TO INSERT FEW COMMENTS. WAS THE FATHER REQUIRED TO BE MADE SUCH A VILLAIN? THE PUNJABI COMMUNITY WAS LIKE A BUNCH OF IDIOTS EXCEPT KRISH. HOWEVER OVERALL THE BOOK WAS QUIET ENJOYING. WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO SOME MORE OF BHAGATNOMICS...........
That's the message i got from this book. I bought it last night & finished it by today afternoon......Firstly,the book cover is Superb.The Best among the Chetan Bhagat's books....Also,apart from the central message that there should not be differences amongst Indians based on language,religion,caste,etc if India is to develop,Chetan Bhagat has given the MOST important philosophy of life to his readers through this book which is- 'There are big problems in everyone's life. It depends upon us how we look at them. If we try to solve them courageously piece-by-piece they are bound to perish one day!!!So,never give up.'
GOOD BOOK TO READ ,ENJOY FOR 4 TO 6 HOURS ....... VALUE FOR MONEY... BUT WHEN U GOOD DEEP INTO BOOKS U CAN MAKE OUT HE HAS BLUFFED HIS LIFE STORY. LIKE ABOUT GOOGLE WHICH DID NOT HAD STASTED THAT TIME ETC...
Hats off to Chetan. I have read the book 5 times in 3 days, and it is much more entertaining than the last 3 and also covers all the 9 ras of a human life. Grab ur copies guys..... A nice deepawali gift for u all.
I have just completed the book and was seriously wondering whether most of the story masala came from the real life experiences of Chetan Bhagat himself? Although his creativity has the shown it's true feathers in this book, but still I missed that yound IITian who reminded me of my days in my engineering college. (not a donation wala B.E though :D) The flow is smooth and expressions are good to go. But as usual he lacks the dominance over the words which many people expect from a novel. 7.5 out of 10 in my opinion.
This is one of the great novel by chetan. The effects of this would surely encourage young couples toward love marriege .Its an revolutionary weapon for a change. This story is much simlar to mine . I am a Punjabi and still convincing my in-laws frm Bihar for this interstate ,intercast marriege with my Brahmin girlfriend.I am an NRI, fallen into love with her during our MBA in Delhi. Chetan..............I have been reading your books and coloums.I am a big fan of yours. I read 'SPARK'too. Its brillient. Thanks for this invaluable book'To States"
I should have stopped at 5 pt..but this is the 4th mistake of my life.....it is more of bollywood script than a novel..... same old story by bhagat...a hero falls in love wit a gal and finally wins...all 4 novels same thng.....read at your own risk...!!!
I have read the book , started it on a casual note but got immersed in it soon . The story is of the writer himself , the difficulty he went through "After" falling in love . The intensity , the sheer dedication that Krish (the protagonist ) had for his love Ananya , made him do and plan silly things . The end is predictable but the narration isn't . Read it . PS : south indians can take a pass at this book , no offence intended , just a friendly advice
Read all books of Chetan.. liked 5 point someone the best but this book I think its my story... :) Received. this book on my 1st marriage Anniversay and read the whole book in 2 days... Amazing book and i m eagerly wating for Chetan's next creation...
I should have stopped at 5 pt..but this is the 4th mistake of my life.....it is more of bollywood script than a novel..... same old story by bhagat...a hero falls in love wit a gal and finally wins...all 4 novels same thng.....read at your own risk...!!!
this one of amzing story which goes in the line of "Five Point someone"..particularly I liked the mental dialogues, written so well. Jus read it...
Just finished reading 2 states. There are moments in the book which make you laugh and there are moments where you will get to think. But largely otherwise this book is just about average. I got a feeling that Chetan has repeated himself in this book. The book is not very long, but seems long and that's not good. This book also seems to be written with the hope of converting it in a movie - too many formulas and impractical situations...probably would have worked slightly better if this were not a semi-autobiographic attempt. At times, it reads extremely corny and immaturish as well. I am sure people who have read Chetan before (like me) will buy this book and read it and kind of enjoy it in parts atleast. His books have been light entertainment and at the price point that they sell, they are definitely worth the money that you put in and more. But whether his books remain with you and if they are your companions for multiple reads and peeks in between, i don't think so. And that's where Chetan now needs to break new grounds. Start with focusing on developing the characters, having more practical and sensible story-plots (not the typical bollywood jokes). All said and done, i will wait for Chetan's next book - he is good fun for a few hours that it takes to read his books.
The story is not as good as "Five Point Someone" or "Three Mistakes of My Life", but the way Chetan has presented it has made it quite enjoyable! Loaded with lots of humour, the book presents some typical things about Punjabi and Tamil people in a very sweet and funny manner. I will give it a 3 out of 5.
I wouldn't have been surprised if the book had an item song in it!!! Actually the only part that was unpredictable was when Smitha comes on stage, i was kept guessing whether she will break into a beedi jalaayile types item song... :) The book is a good read... though thoroughly predictable it was probably meant to be that way so as to identify with the reader... Some dialogues are really funny... like the "kick ass and need ice" simile... brings a smile to your face... all in all the best part of the book is the Dedication... have fun all ye readers!!!!

well, five point someone came out when we'd just entered college.. and i'm talking about one of those residential colleges where hostel life is the most important aspect of college life, per se. got quite blown by the mere frivolity of it, the dashing cheekiness. it was probably the worst bit of english literature i'd read till then, and though i was aware of that fact, i couldn't help the laughter and the adrenaline rush that came with reading through the bittersweet exploits of that blundering adoloscent troika. Five years down the line, Mr Bhagat has produced two more 'novels' in that confused Indianised english lingo. Probably he should've stopped at FPS, probably he shouldn't even have written FPS itself, given that in the 'accepted' sense of the expression, he's by no means a 'real author'. Instead, he went on writing his boorish stories, returned to India and finally quit his job in order to "devote his entire time to writing and make change happen in the country". i can't say he is by any means a good writer, but i must say i have to respect his guts and his philosophy of life. English books at 95/- was never looked at as a good idea in India, but he made that idea transform the very definition of 'English readers in India'. and that's what i like about this man, he probably knows about his own limitations; he writes bad english and haven't had a mature plot to offer since FPS (though i'm not sure if the word mature really goes with FPS). but he wants to write, and he has certain opinions that he wants to propagate through his books and articles (yes, in the much-maligned TOI itself!) and he goes on doing that. and in doing that he's already en route achieving that thing which, eventually, is the most cherished goal of all well-intentioned art, IMPACT. and probably the same logic holds with Bollywood and TOI. i, for myself, will buy this book and read it. thumbs up, Mr Bhagat!
chetan bhagat is the writer of the new generation......!his books concentrate upon the main problems of the soceity....!be it caste,religion.........and that too in a humourous way....!i like his books a lot....after his hattrick with 3 hit books.....!my expectations are sky high....!hope this book too is good like the previous three.....!lastly,the younger generation would like the idea of reading this book beacause love is an issue you get the very next door...!so best of luck.....chetan..!
Yes, let's see. I enjoyed reading all his 3 previous books. I liked Five Point Someone the best. It is a good novel. I can't wait for his new novel: 2 States: The Story of My Marriage. I haven't pre-ordered it because I'd prefer visiting my favourite bookstore and buy it from there. Chetan Bhagat writes well. Uses very simple language. Particularly his storyline was something to write about in his novel "The Three Mistakes of My Life." I liked the love story in it. I have just finished reading "The Lost Symbol" (by Dan Brown), which I have pre-ordered Online. I guess, I must raise a toast reading Chetan Bhagat's new novel next. I think I am going great on that aspect!!
