Nikon D3100 DSLR Camera@@@I've been researching on several entry level DSLR's (Canon 1100D, Sony SLT A35 to name a couple) since over a few months and finally narrowed on this marvel. Reasons to go for this and not the others are: A: Slightly larger sensor size. B: More megapixels (I know it doesn't really matter but helps if you're to crop your shots). C: Higher ISO capabilities. D: Overall better value for buck. Review: On first use it really does not feel like an entry level DSLR at all. As a matter of fact, Even when compared with higher end's like the D90, not a lot of difference can be observed (Tested with the same 50mm AF-S lens). If you are a beginner into professional photography, the Guide or Full auto mode can do wonders. However, the full potential of this beast can be felt under the Full manual mode. I've read several opinions on how this one cannot keep the shots distortion free on lower shutter speeds but, personally, I've tested it while in my car with considerable amount of vibration and with very low shutter speeds, and it was unbelievably stable and shots were great. I'm talking about using with the kit 18-55 lens here. It'd be way better with a prime or telephoto. Additionally, worrying about lack of juice is also a no no with this beast. With full charge, it lasted for more than a day with about 430 RAW / 500 JPEG shots. Overall, its a beautiful piece of hardware to have for any photographer. Especially if you are a beginner, this would serve as the wand for a wizard !
I have personally owned this for over a year now, and it doesn't stop to surprise me every day, have been in a trip couple of time and with the basic kit lens also its awesome. recently have upgraded to Tamron 18-200, and this camera performs really well.. Pros: 1, Easy to use and best for a newcomer in DSLR, shooting modes are very easy 2. Light and compact, doesn't hurt to carry all day long 3, Awesome Picture reproduction, set ur aperture right and enjoy. 4, vast setting option to play with your imagination and creativity 5, In camera editing is also good, u can do basic editing there itself. 6, Video is great even in low light, have captured almost every occasion. 7, Good ISO range and picture is great even at higher ISO Cons: 1, Only 3FPS shutter speed which is little less for a DSLR. 2, No wireless remote support Suprising!!! Verdict. One can do wonders with this camera, if you are on budget go for it you will not regret, if you want to spend more then go for D90 or D7100, nothing less then that, as it will do every thing what others mid levels can.Save money and invest in a couple of good lenses and accessories.. I love my camera...
THIS IS MY FIRST DSLR AND BLV ME IT IS REALLY EASY TO OPERATE.I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE PIC QUALITY.ITS A REAL STEAL IN THIS PRICE RANGE.EXCELLENT PACKING AND QUICK DELIVERY BY FLIPKART IS A BONUS.
Though I was a total Amateur at this Photography thing , I was Very Interested and Passionate about Photography . Spoke to many Friends who have DSLR s . Finally was in a Dilemma whether to go for CANON or NIKON ! and that too a Starter Edition at a Budget Price . After a long week Research Ordered this . Was Very Happy with the DELIVERY - PERFECT PACKING . 10 / 10 . And coming to Performance - Easy to use and Awesome Photos . You just Have to Spend time with The Camera. You can Create wonders with this Little Beauty NIKON D3100 .
In case you're short of budget, but still interested in photography, this is the camera you should go with. Availed this at a remarkably low price of 21.7k in Jan. Simply amazed with the quality of product. If you know how to operate a DSLR, you'll be able to get mind blowing shots. On screen resolution & low light performance are the only turn-off, rest everything is simply great. Macro shots are not that great, you'll need a separate lens for those. In case you're just starting off, guide mode comes to your rescue. Flipkart still offers the best service, packaging and delivery in the e-commerce market. (Y)
ordered nikon d3100 in a discount scheme. camera pack from nikon seems a bit old. camera runs ok but camera bag is damaged. Damage is big enough and one can easiky spot it. i fear if flipkart has delivered me fresh piece or not. i have reported this to customer care. they say somebody will call me from flipkart in two days and tell what to do. i m dissappointed how careless is nikon or flipkart or seller. bigger fear is flipkart knowingly putting second hand or damged piece for sale in discount. please be aware
for its price, its the best camera in the market... flipkart (WS Retail to be precise) offered a great discount and i got it for just 22k!!! delivered before the expected date and the packing was awesome as always... now coming to the camera, firstly, the grip is too good... i guess thats true for all nikons... the sensor is great, depth is more than great, full hd recording is a bonus... great images... overall, too satisfied.... awesome, awesome and awesome....
i had experience with the model and i am satisfied with result where as i required more models also if you give me better price.
It’s a very good entry level DSLR, the quality of the product is top notch. Remember you will have to spend lot of money later on AF-S lenses as the AF lens does not focus on this body. Also this does not have an IR sensor strange considering that D3000 has it, so what it means, it means that you won’t be able to take photographs through a remote. Another good feature missing is Exposure Bracketing. But still it is a very good buy at this cost. I would surely recommend this to anyone interested in starting photography with DSLR’s.
Nikon is always the best. After so much research, comparison and dilemma final purchased D3100 and today am happy user of the product. It is as perfect as decribed.
Got the camera from Flipkart within 3 days and at amazing price of 21.5K I feel it is the best entry level DSLR that you can purchase to get started. The lens is elementary and useful for everyday shots. Lens is a critical requirement if you want to do some advance photo techniques. Overall pretty good for the price!
I bought this nikon D3100 camera 3 years back and its great.I got a lens of 18-55, sufficient for me. This is basically the cheapest DSLR for amateurs like me. A great buy and definitely value for money. I have been practicing photography with this for all these years. Pros: - many settings available. - great picture quality. - nice and sturdy. - value for money Cons: - zoom is too less (my choice of zoom) apart from that nothing at all I would recommend this camera to any and every one. Superb!!! But sadly I did not buy it from flipkart.
I purchased this from flipkart 1 month back. It's a good product but not great. I just want to compare it with D5100 which I also have. 1. Quality of picture is good and you feel like it's almost similar to D5100 pictures even though it's 14.2 mega pixel 2. Features are almost similar like D5100 except few like you have less option of ISO settings which is important 3. The worst part about this product is it's display screen resolution is very less if you compare with D5100. You cannot say picture is good or bad if you check it in the screen. It's only a problem for a beginner, but I think this camera only for beginners. My suggestion is, if price is not much of your concern go for D5100. You wont disappoint. If you can spend more go for D5200
This is my first DSLR and I should say that it fits in well for a novice, from a price as well as features point of view. Note: The following is not from comparison with other entry level DSLRs pros + value for money + VR lens work well, avoiding shaky pictures + camera bag is decent + good for learning photography in manual mode + less bulky cons - wireless remote-shutter-release-accessory not available from Nikon Thanks !!
This is my first experience with DSLR. I am not that good at review but few insights I can reveal. It was an awesome experience right from the day I ordered to the day I took my first Picture shot. Thanks to Flipkart the product came within 3 days in a nicely packed box. All the items as promised were present like, the camera bag, SD card, cables, belt, lens, and the camera itself along with two invoice copies. All the instructions were pictorially given and I followed them for lens fixing, belt , battery, SD card fitting,etc. I tried in the Auto mode in the beginning, I can say the quality was too good. I am still exploring on the details. As a beginner, I think it is good to start with this product. This is in comparison to Canon base version it seems, I only bought this because of the discount available in flipkart. If you guys are like me as a beginner and also looking for value for money, I would say go for it. You may upgrade to higher versions later on. Just start experimenting with this to know all the features and your appreciation on the quality of picture starts increasing day by day, contrary to what you see if you directly buy a high end camera. You will know the in and out of any camera, you don't get cheated and stranded in such discussions ( yeah it happens :))
Nikon has developed a habit of making very attractive entry-level DSLRs, which are rarely the best specified but cleverly designed so that they're easy and enjoyable to shoot with. The D3001 fitted this pattern perfectly. The D3100 is built around a 14.2 megapixel CMOS sensor, bringing not only live view but also Full HD video capture to Nikon's entry-level model for the first time. In fact, this made it the first Nikon DSLR to offer 1920x1080 movie recording. It can only record clips up to about ten minutes long (due to a 4Gb maximum file size limitation shared by all DSLRs), but this still counts as an impressive feature addition at this level. Best Entry Level DSLR.. :)
I have ordered Nikon D3100 DSLR on 28.01.'14 @ 11pm and I Received the item on 01.02.'14 afternoon. It was carefully packed to avoid damages in transit and found in good condition. The free 4gb Memory card was sticked on external plastic wrapper with cello tape was not easy to find out and about to throw away with it. Otherwise the packing was so good. I am not a "Photographer" but interested in that art.. earlier i have been using Nikon FM 10 SLR film camera. when the film cameras became part of history, i tried compact camera and went on searching for a DSLR to suit my needs and pocket.. after going through several reviews, i found D3100 with a rock bottom price 21788/- is the one i am searching for..! so it happened. i have only tried some trial shots with it and found the result is excellent.
Thanks to flipkart. I got this product for the best price 19600 after applying HSBC cashback offer. I just took this camera for capturing photos of indoor events and few outdoor occasions. After taking some pictures I am confident that it will serve my purpose.
Good product for beginners, with large image sensor!. The white spot on lens not affected picture quality. Everyone Should have to purchase an extra battery because you will need those later..! Enough said.!
I have bought on expected date. Delivered in good condition. Camera results is good. I am feeling very energetic after buying a this product. I have captured my daughter function through the device and results is awesome.
Impressed by the features on the papers .. Will buy one soon from flipkart... Looks superb as a entry level DSLR...
This is an awesome product. The kit lens is great and will give you good pictures. If you wish to learn or pursue photography this could be exactly what you need to step into the world of photography.
Good DSLR to start with. 18-55 lens is good, you can get moderate BOKEH with this lens. Better go for a lens with lesser stops or f-number . Awesome camera though. Build quality is way better than the plastic body of Cannon 1100D from the same range. For better reviews ask Jared Polin on youtube. He is a pro and will explain this camera better.
Good quality product from Nikon.The features are good.Flipcart service is excellent.The price has been reduced in the past one week as nikon stopped the production of d3100 and lifted the minimum price limit on the product,so the seller can able sell the product at minimum price.Better to wait for a few more days as price may drop further.
This is my first digital camera and I had spent a lot of time researching it. The street price was around Rs. 30000 but flipkart managed to give me the same camera (with free bag and 4GB Lexor SDHC card) for around Rs. 23000. Now about the camera- it is one of the best photography kits available, although the 18-55mm zoom range feels a bit low. I don't know why people say that the kit lens is bad. I have managed to take a few excellent shots with it and even some macro shots, which are decent. The in camera RAW processing is enough for me to touch up my photos and the fact that it can do a sort of double exposure is an added plus. I am planning to upgrade my zoom range with the 55-200mm lens in the near future. Now about Flipkart and its delivery. I had ordered it on a saturday and selected priority delivery as i required it on monday. Although it cost Rs. 90 extra it was worth it. The camera came on the promised day delivered by their courier guy. He carried it separately in a bag so as not to damage it( which might have occured if it had been crammed with other products). The camera was extremely well packed with bubble wrap. Hope that Flipkart keeps up its excellent service.
If you are planning for a DSLR, this is the best one for starters. Better than point and shoot cameras, the picture quality is awesome. Its VR technology reduces blurs because of handshake. Better shooting experience if you learn the basics of DSLR shooting. However, you will have to compromise with the zoom as being being DSLR you will have to purchase other lens with zoom features.....but who cares...nobody shoots distant object in normal course. In all, it is a must buy camera...:-)
Took this cam on a great discount, And like everyone was confused between Canon 600D & Nikon D5100. Finally switched to buy Nikon as there was no much difference between them. The kit lens is just amazing for normal photography...Loving the camera...If u r are planning to buy an entry level DSLR just go for it i bet u wont regret. Packing of flipkart is just too good.....Just love FLIPKART....!!!!!!!
Wonderful Entry Level DSLR Camera... I am in love with it. Wonderful service by Flipkart. Excellent Packing
Its a great camera especially for someone who has just started using DSLRs. The range is great and you can use your imagination to get whatever results you want. The only thing which is lacking is a good zoom, which I learnt is the same with all DSLRs. You need to buy a separate lens for that. Start using one and you will know!
...and with just the right price. With the equally competent Canon 1100D, the Nikon 3100 has placed DSLR photography within the affordable reach of many enthusiasts. If you are upgrading from the point-and-shoot machines, you cannot go wrong with a Nikon 3100 or its successor, the Nikon 3200. Even if your budget is much more, if you are starting with DSLR photography, start with the Nikon 3100 or 3200. Save your money for future upgrades. Remember, camera bodies go out of style in 2 years; camera lenses live on forever. As you advance your skills, you'll need different lenses; one lens does not fit all requirements. The available zoom with the kit 18-55mm VR lens is 3x zoom in point and shoot terminology. And it's 3x optical - not digital. An optical zoom is a true zoom lens, like the zoom lens you’d use on a film camera. They produce much better-quality images.
Personally I am a Nikon fan, I have used numerous point and shoot Nikon cameras. The last one was Nikon L120. I am a photography enthusiast and was in search of a good DSLR to start off my passion. I have read numerous blogs and consulted few of my photographer friends. And thus ended up buying the Nikon D3100. There is a lot to learn in it and as a starter I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Will be soon buying few lenses to tweek up the came. I strongly recommend anyone who wants to venture into the photography world and have a budget around 25k, to buy the Nikon D3100. And thanks to flipkart for their super fast delivery.
I just bought this camera few days back, this is my first dslr, I am new to Manual mode but coping well with different composition situations till date based on the outputs I have got. I chose this over Canon 1100D as it was a better choice after checking reviews and after using both little bit in camera shops etc :) . Pros:- Good Grip Kit lens (18-55) is good, you can take decent bokeh Autofocus system is supposedly good, it has a 3D tracking system although I use manual focus most of time. ISO is good till 1600 which is the limit you should try to work with adjusting other parameters, lens permitted, then it becomes grainy as you go further, expecting something useable in 3200 is ambitious, Forget about H1 and H2. If you are getting into DSLR zone for the first time then you cannot find a better camera then this one. You can always upgrade to a better and advanced one in few years time till you get good with calculating correct exposure as per situation and your requirement. This camera can give you photos, much better than its price suggests and its easy to use with most options available via buttons on the camera. There is a function button on the left side of lens, which can be used to control ISO. Cons:- Screen could have been a tad better in terms of resolution, but that's just too much to ask at this price, however its good as it is, if you are not too finicky. As everyone knows, delivery of flipkart is its strong point, no qualms about it. Cheers. :)
After a long research to buy my first DSLR I settled on Nikon D3100. I also surveyed in local market and to my surprise I got cheaper price in flipkart. Flipkart delivery service was good as usual. The camera is more than awesome. Its fits perfectly in the hand, easy to do all operations with given buttons. The kit lens is good for some outstanding day to day shooting. Don't expect long distance shoots as it doesn't have too much zoom. It took me a little while to find all the functions and all the buttons' work. A little advice , instead of that inbuilt guide mode just youtube a little and you will know everything about the camera functions in minutes. Already enjoying my camera, don't go for anything else in this range . You will surely be amazed at its performance.
I LOVE THIS NIKON 3100 its awesome. I am from Darjeeling and love photography since my childhood. This Camera is beyond your expectations...By looks,. by features by its every single usages and its configuration ....better than Canon D1100..and most of other cameras.....and i can bet you will enjoy your photography at its best..i am mentally SATISFIED...thank you Flipkart and Nikon...
The camera lovers really would like to go for it. Am a big fan of shooting pics. i usually spend 2-3 months on trips and tours. I bought a camera last week on a huge offer from the Panasonic. Its really fun to click on it.
This was my 3rd shopping item from flipkart and guess it is one of the highest for me(price) item bought online! I always prefer going to shop and buying the product whether it is an electronic product or a hand made item. But flipkart changed my way of thinking and now I prefer "Shopping nahi flipkart karo"! About shipping is concerned - i received product within 72 hrs of booking. Coming to the camera review-- I investigated almost all the websites related to buying a beginner's cum budget DSLR. Even saw videos and also flipkart's user reviews. Finally came down to NIKON D3100, CANON 550D, NIKON 3200. Canon 550D: excellent built quality with autofocus motor which can be used by any lens. but as a beginners DSLR it was too hefty as it crossed almost 30k! NIKON D3200: again nikon's great value for money product and latest image processing technology which is EXPEED 3 processor and 24.1 MP. but the budget was not in my hand! NIKON D3100: Great VFM and with 14.2 MP with 1080 video recording what more you want? As it is a DSLR, a better lens a better photo reproduction! hence will save money for future to buy a 50mm lens. here are PROS and CONS PROS: 1. Excellent built quality compared to other DSLR's at that price. 2. Price is much cheap and a good beginners DSLR camera 3. video shoot at 1080p with 24fps and 4k resolution images! 4. continous autofocus in movie mode. 5. 11 point autofocus (read the description) 6. easy to handle. CONS: 1. no external MIC attachment 2. older processor EXPEED 2 3. 1080p video shoot should have been at 30fps 4. no autofocus motor which causes you to buy lens with in-built autofocus lens in future which is very high in price.
So far I am a regular buyer from Flipcart for books and for the first time I bought Nikon D 3100 after lot of research and analysis. First of all hats off to flipcart for delivering the camera in just two days with excellent packaging to prevent any damage and with 2500/- Rs less with the competing website. Second, The camera is just perfect for beginners. For advance images you can substitute it with Tamron or Sigma 70-300 mm lens,again I feel Tamron lens is a better one. The rubberized grip is very good for holding the camera and guide mode for shooting is very user friendly. Again I want to clarify one thing that above 10 megapixel any SLR camera is good, so don't chases only megapixels while choosing a camera. Remember it is how you shoot a picture determines its quality and not megapixels. So practice guys with this new weapon (I call it weapon as my other hobby is shooting ) and have a great picture......! Animesh Srivastava Gurgaon
I bought this camera almost a year back not from flipkart but i bought my Tamron 70-300 mm lens from flipkart, its an amzing camera in its price there is no alternative Of D3100, very good in HD video, Easy to Use and excellent indoor & Outdoor picture quality,
The Product reached me safely.the packing was good. and mainly the offer which i got is superb.so will shop again in flipcart
Hello All, I am not at all a professional photographer so if you are just like me then you should read this review. You will find many reviews on Flipkart by professionals so no doubt this camera is good. Now a days even folks from villages know, if they are buying camera for the first time then they should go for Nikon and Canon. Digital camera photography is like swimming in a river and once you own DSLR you jump into the ocean. When I told my friend that I bought a Nikon D3100 he told me (He is a professional photographer) that I should gone for Nikon D5100. I am happy with my choice because I saved some money and I am not a professional photographer ;-) Celebrate Life. Yogi
I have bought a Nikon DSLR from some diff vendor not Flipkart as i got a better deal with Tripod and extra items which i dint get here. Here are some comparisons for the two heavy weights in this 30 K within DSLR segment.Pros of this nikon i will mention below 1)12.2 MP for canon EOS but 14.2 MP for Nikon as MP doesnt matter in DSLR 2)Full hd record possible 1080P@24frames per second but canon 720P supported 3) has a Comparitively larger display 4)Significantly larger sensor 5)Support 205 lenses but canon support 195 lenses 6)Focus point are more 11 vs 9 7)It give 10% better image quality 8)it has contrast Auto detection vs none 9)its detects better colour compared to nikon 10)ISO is less noisy vs canon Cons are similar for both comparatively 1)Slow max shutter speed 2)Below avg view finder 3)no HDR camera inbuilt 4)Slow continuous shooting based on the shutter speed 5)No image stabilization (may be it can blur) 6)Panorama stitching is bad 7)Poor max light sensitivity 8)No weather shield. risk of dust and water entering Warranty cover and items u can buy 1) gives warranty for the inner components 2) doesn't cover battery can withstand 450 shots approx 3) buy an extra 16 GB or 32 GB sandisk SDHC card as the kit comes with 4 GB which will be not sufficient using RAW+JPEG mode 4) cleaning kit for Lens and stuff 5) UV filter for camera lens if you want to assure long run happy shopping buddies
I must say that for amateur photographer the Nikon D3100 is best camera...where you can catch the wonderful moments of life/nature with you imagination. The image captured by Nikon D3100 are crisp and clear, and ya lots of settings so need to read a manual and some of the website to know how take better image ;-) The product reached late, but its worth product at cheaper price then other online shopping website. My recommendation - Go For Nikon D3100
I have done lots of research, I am confused between D3200, D5100, canon 600D and sony a58, but all of them little expensive and I get this on Flipkart @21k. Its a too good a deal to miss and now I can spend my money to buy some lenses. If you are new to DSLR photography it will give you enough satisfaction. Hats off to flipkart. mind blowing service. they deliver me within 2 days. Downside of this camera is that it is launched in 2010 and also the screen's resolution is poor and it doesn't have built-in focus motor unlike Canon's so you have to buy the lenses that have focus motor built in and they cost you more.
This is really an awesome camera i bought it two months ago and using it at the fullest. This DSLR is really good for for the beginners specially the guide mode is just awesome . Image quality no doubt is very good . Ergonomics is simply very good when compared to canon 1100d . This camera is really a boon to photographers who want to be out of the point and shoot world .
Best Camera to start learning on how to use a DSLR , Best Photo / Video Quality after using only Point & Shoot for long years. Many other Settings to explore . NB : Pls Guide on a online Link to learn more about DSLR ...
Hi, First of all i would like to thanks to flip kart for nice service. secondly,if i want to talk about Nikon D3100 .its really superb. last week i got this product from flip kart. i clicked some round 300 pictures . its really fabulous. and the clarity of the pictures and videos are really awesome.. I am really enjoying a lot with my Nikon D 3100. Thanking You Vishwanath Hegde
Your Review was a good one, but have little inaccuracies, i too have been using this DSLR for 18 months with sb 400 flash and i bought it for 28500 then. The thing is that it can continuously auto focus while video recording and been one of the first entry level SLR to do so. The problem with video recording is that, it can only shoot 1080p at 24fps. While many other entry level SLR's can do it at 30 fps. The continuous auto focus can cause noise in the video which is a drawback.
I have been using my D3100 for about a year and half now. When I bought it then it was for 29,000 with kit-lens. I see that the price has not dropped much - that tells something about its credence. When it was launched, buying this was a no-brainer- it was simply the best entry level DSLR available in the price range then. But now a D5100, or maybe Canon 550D if you can stretch a little, will be a better VFM buy IMHO. The only thing which troubles me with this camera is the absence of bracketing feature and also absence of in-built focus motor. So I have to buy lenses which have their own in-built focus motor if I want Auto-focus to work on my D3100. These lenses are more costlier than those without in-built focus motor. Pros of D3100: - Cheap and good VFM - Respectable image quality - Very nicely laid out physical controls - A very sharp and capable kit-lens - Lovely High ISO performance - Silent shutter - Small & light - Live view is a boon in some situations - 1080p video capturing Cons - No in-built focus motor - No bracketing of any kind - Doesn't have wireless remote shutter compatibility(have to use wired ones) - In-built flash can not commandeer other slave flashes - No constant auto-focus during video capture As I said it was a no-brainer choice at the time when it was launched about 2 years back. Today you got other options to consider, that said this camera still stands against most respectably.
Zooming? we are talking about a DSLR here, not a tiny sensor P&S camera. If you don't know what you are talking about, don't make such stupid, joke of the 21st century comments. DSLR doesn't deal in Number X zoom, it uses the term focal length to specify its reach, the 18-55mm lens that comes with a d3100 is a decent lens, if you need to take faraway stuff you have to buy a telephoto lens, ask any real photographer, photography is not about zooming, they zoom with their legs, many of them opt "primes" (un zoomable) for the superior quality of glass.
This was my first DLSR. Needless to say, the Flipkart delivery was prompt with all documentation and good packaging. The D3100 is better buy than its Canon competition. The quality and feel of the product is great. Good for new DSLR users. With a little bit of understanding you can start shooting great pictures in no time. I will recommend this product to all.
One of the best in the given price range. If you are looking for a dslr to learn and play around with it or just starting out with photography, this is definitely a good buy. For those of you who are more interested in appearing in amazing looking photos, a point and shoot maybe a better idea though the nikon d3100 has plenty of automatic modes. However if you are truly in ISO controls pretty easy to learn and use. Also the camera is at its best for photography up close, my best shots are close ups, with the lens that comes up with it distant photography is not very good. You will need a good zoom lens for that stuff.
I got my first DSLR a few days back. It is a Nikon 3100D. Its an awesome camera in a descent budget. I got some photographer friends with this cam, and the results are amazing. But I think the price in flipkart is a little higher than local stores. Anyway about camera its the best one for a beginner. It got quality, style and potential.
This is my 1st D-SLR Camera. I'm really impressed with it and would recommend to all of those who are going to buy their 1st D-SLR Camera. It has all the features that one would expect from a good camera and will definitely please those who are looking for a good D-SLR under Rs.30,000. A must buy I'd say... Cheers
I bought this camera three weeks ago from local market as I couldn't get EMI facility from flipkart. After using it heavily for three weeks, I can say that this is a good camera, specially suitable for beginners. All the other reviewers have already given their views and they are more or less same for me too. However, this camera has one very major shortcoming which no one has mentioned. IT DOESN'T SUPPORT A WIRELESS REMOTE. If you plan to do light painting or trick photography, a wireless remote is absolutely necessary. I did not check this small fact prior to buying and now I am regretting as my primary objective was to experiment with light painting. If you are not bothered by that, then this is the perfect camera for starters. I am deducting two stars only because of that.
Amazing for beginners,specially teen who wish to upload good pictures on social networking sites :) Heads-up to NIKON for this amazing camera. Guide mode is not required much really but helpful is under the guidance of a PRO photographer. Auto focus isn't much help either but we all know what is landscape and portraits e.t.c !
I am impressed .This is my first DSLR and I am loving it. First thing I should tell here so many ppl has mentioned very constructive comments in the review. Before buying this DSLR I was pretty confused on which one to buy say in my list Nikon D3100 Canon 1100D Canon 550D Nikon D5100
Best for beginners. Plenty of features to experiment with.. offers great flexibility by inclusion of vibration resistant nikor kit lens.. Also doubles as a "point and shoot" camera for those who are lazy enough to experiment things.. Best buy..
Best entry level camera, researched a lot before finally buying it. Good in capturing kids precious moments. Was initially confused between point n shoot vs slr, point n shoot response is slow. Battery life is awesome and delivery was quick.
Its been 8 months im using it n im totally happy with this camera. Has all the feature that you might expect from a camera. The 18-55mm lens which come with the camera is good for general purpose use but it wont be long before you start feeling its limited zooming ability. So, be ready to buy a zoom lens soon. It has good battery backup, user friendly ,easy to operate. the most recommended product if you are thinking to move from your point n shoot to SLR..Its the best in its range..for sure!! Last thing for general users (people who just want a good camera). I see SLRs these days in everybodies hand because it has gone cheap. You can afford it doesn't mean you should buy it. SLRs are those people want spend lot of time in photography. People who want good camera for their family trip should go for point n shoot. there are some really good PnP in the market, look for it.
i purchased a NIKON L23 coolpix in October 2011 but somehow its click button came out when i searched for your service center i was shocked to see u have rarely 2 or 3 service centres in Delhi NCR the story does not ends here wen i visited one of your service center they told me to go to Gurgaon which is ur main service station then i went dere they deposited 275 Rs.(Not Refundable) just to tell me that ur button will be imported from HongKong and some chip as well so as it is coming from Hong Kong will cost you 2000 rs. I want to ask the the hell u r operating in India when every thing you are importing fron Hongkong and taking this cost from end customer after taking non refundable money. "
Great product, best camera in Entry Level DSLR category! The camera looks great, has a very good build quality and a nice grip too. The Flyer/Manual which came with the camera is very useful to understand its various functions for beginners. The 'Guide' mode is really awesome to understand your new camera better. While initially I was in a dilemma whether to go for Canon 1100D or this one, finally, I feel, my choice was a right one. Could have been better in terms of performance in low light.
i hve compared all entry level dslr camera of nikon and canon company, and i found that nikon d3100 is the best one for new user of dslr camera. no doubt canon dslr like eos 550d is more advance than d3100, but its cost is higher than nikon d3100. my sugession is if you are a professional photographer then you must go for canon dslr, if photography is ur passion then nikon dslr is best. Nikon d3100 is my dream and i'll take it soon.
Nikon D3100 is a awesome entry level SLR. If you are going from Point and Shoot to SLR for the first time, go for this. If you are a professional, stay with the more expensive cameras. I did a extensive study and compared it to Canon 1100. If most site and by most photo-enthusiasts, Nikon gets the vote! Have taken some good close up and portraits with this camera.
Summary: Great starter to DSLR for beginners like me Easy to learn photography with this camera Excellent performance for the price Will recommend a tripod (if you are very serious about photography/night shots) I have been shooting using my point & shoot camera till date and wanted to upgrade to a better camera. At the same time I was intimidated by the myriad terms and features associated with a SLR. After due research, I had ordered this gem of a camera on Flipkart and got it delivered a month ago. First mention is about how easy it is to use the camera and the additional flyer materials that came with the camera. The flyer contained easy set up guide to get you started with the camera without having to read the entire manual. On the camera as well you have guide mode which makes your life a breeze when it comes to taking photos. It has easy suggestions and 'how to' for th day to day usage scenarios and hence helps you to learn photography rather than use the auto mode. Secondly the performance has been phenomenal and the battery life has been way better than what I had feared it will be. It also has sensors to detect light and it warns you if the subject is too dark or too bright prompting you to change exposure or shutter speed. If you are a person inclined to learn photography then you will use these hints and the light in the room to update your brain and learn yourself. Only downside (which is actually not a downside for this price) is the performance under low light. You need to have incredibly steady hands or a tripod to take night portraits to avoid blurry images.
I had bad luck enough, I could not order this Camera in Flipkart as it was out of stock ! So, some how I got it from store. I always admire service of Flipkart, no doubt about it. And coming to D3100, as many have told already this is the best entry level DSLR. I agree with the same. Professionals, they chose wisely their pro DSLR camera. But for beginners like me, we have to go through lot of research, hand on device(demo in stores)which are very much essential. So did I, did lot of work before chosing entry level DSLR. Comparing specs of D3100 and Canon 1100D you may find differnces and get confuse !! Let me tell you both are like almost equal. Chose any one and later you won'r regret. The thing you have to look for grip. Go to any store, ask for demo, check the grip of both the cams for your hand. which feels best, choose that one.. as I asid, you won't regret. As for as I have choosed this one. I am Loving more this piece day by day. Clarity is amazing at lesser zoom, when you zoom at large focal length Tripod is must for clarity. The best thing for beginner is you will learn a lot as time passes. Then you will be at the stage of Proffessional, and then chose you pro level DSLR at the price you can afford for.. I repeat you will not regret but you will start love and learn this..!! Have a happy Clicks !!
The Camera has an excellent look with fine picture quality. It is handy with a good camera feel. The major drawback in this camera is the Manual Zoom. Even cheaper Digital cameras have a digital 12x zoom. The zoom should have been much better and operational with a button. This is a major disappointment. The Flash is weak and does not cover even 10 ft distance. I wish Nikon could improve these features at this price.
I was very cautious in choosing my first DSLR. Made a lot of comparison with D3100 and D5100. AS I can afford to 30K, and analyzed there's less difference in D3100 when compared to D5100, I opted for D3100. And I relized its not a wrong decision. Its worth my money. I spent 13K on 55-300mm lens and now am all set to go for wonderful Photo shoot. Thanks to Flipkart for the wonderful service.
I was watching for a SLR camera at @ flipkart when I saw this beauty.It was like love at first sight and after watching this camera ("'Nikon D3100'") I couldn't sleep for days. All its features are like ................ I can't xpress in words. I was a little confused between this and Canon EOS 1100D but then I chose this.
I am impressed .This is my first DSLR and I am loving it. First thing I should tell here so many ppl has mentioned very constructive comments in the review. Before buying this DSLR I was pretty confused on which one to buy say in my list Nikon D3100 Canon 1100D Canon 550D Nikon D5100 But I dont have lots of money per se. After doing so much research I opted for Nikon D3100 coz the gripping was so good in my hand than any others. I have tried Canon 550D too ... it is a good camera to be very frank. But if u think carefully I would suggest to buy the Nikon D3100 body with a prime lense either 50mm 1.8G or 35 mm 1.8G , Nikkor offcourse. I ma using this camera for more than 3 months, no problem found whatsover and I ma very satisfied. But it might seem that the image is bit natural in ur DSLR, I have trick for u , if u check Canon 550D it will provide u much saturated color more vibrant than Nikon D3100. So make ur camera setting color as vivid and increase the saturation manually from the menu. U wont regret this buy . Trust me.
Purchased this about 3 weeks back, and am amazed at its performance: - My decision to buy Nikon D3100 v/s Canon 1100D was not bad. Though more expensive, the feel in hand, compactness, sensor size, HD movies capability, 3" dispalay, rubber grip tilted my decision towards Nikon. - excellent image quality & low noise at 14MP, even with flash. - Kit lens has its limitations, but ok for me to begin with experimenting. - I manual focusing for macro / close up shots much better than autofocus. - The HD video mode delivers excellent quality movies. - The built in flash looks small, but has enough power to take good snaps at indoor functions. I recently took more than 150 photos at my niece's wedding, and the result was great. - I prefer to shoot in A (aperture priority) or Manual M mode. - I plan to buy a 50mm stand alone lens followed by 55 - 300 zoom. - In short, go for Nikon D3100!!
Only Nikon AF-S lenses will auto focus on D3100. Nikon chose to not put a focusing motor in the D3000, D3100, D5000 and D5100 so you'd have to buy the more expensive AF-S lenses that have a focusing motor in the lens. The Nikon AF 50mm f1.8D is about $140.00 while the new Nikon AF-S 50mm f1.8G is about $220.00 - a nice extra $80.00 or thereabouts in profit for Nikon. If you use the AF 50mm f1.8D on your D3100 you will have to manually focus the lens. It will not auto focus on your camera.
i think this camera is by far nikons best entry level camera. i own this camera for about 8 months now and have enjoyed it thoroughly. no problems with the working and the camera. dont know about flipkart services for cameras, havent bought a camera off flipkart, but they do have some great deals and i trust them enough.
Flipkart did a great job with the package for me.. got it in proper packaging in 4 days. The camera actually was a pure entry-level SLR camera.. whereas I misunderstood it as better than the non-SLR high mega-pixel cameras. I will still take time to understand the real quality of SLR photos against another non-SLR, compact higher megapixel, half the rate camera I have. This nikon is particularly only 10 MP and has only 35mm zoom with the lens that comes with the package.. which is I guess approx 3x optical zoom. so that was another disappointing thing. Control of aperture, shutter time, etc., was very advanced compared to non-SLR. I would rate it 5.. because flipkart was not the reason for my disappointment. I probably should have done a comparison with a non-SLR camera with respect to my expectations and simple photography style.
I thought for quite some time between this and canon 1000D as the price difference was quite a bit and as I don't get money out of my photography hobby it was tough to spend the extra. It was worth it for two reason: second hand lens (cheaper) for Nikon exist at indian ebay but almost none for Canon or Pentax, Second reason was there are more cheaper and better lens for Nikon than Canon. Use this with Nikon 35mm f1.8, you will know why you needed a DSLR which otherwise is a bulky, costly and can not take everywhere kind of lens. Use the kit lens for video, VR on that lens will be handy and when you grow with the system, look for cheaper second hand lens for special purpose. for example I have an excellent 135/2.8 tele lens made 30 years back for ~5000 which works like magic.
Lets begin! Nikon , one of the best camera makers -- we all know right. Again the company has done it with D3100. If you are a regular digital camera user and buying this as you first DSLR you will fall in love with it at first look (really). The basics; You can get the specs from any where you want so i am not wasting in writing it. Still, i will have a say about the image sensor size which is the heart of any camera and trust me this has a golden heart. If you wish to know the conversion of sensor size and 35mm comparison it is provided in the manual. Taking further the sensor is CMOS , a better variant than the D3000 which has a CCD sensor. Dont go in detail just know that CMOS is better in comparison. The build of the camera--9/10 Holding position -- very good . you feel confident when you hold it. Like it will nor slip out out. Dial and back panel buttons -- good position and quick access function. Lens - Fair enough for starters and VR -- AF does the job really well. Lack of zoom (if somebody want it). Taking photos: As easy as a DSLR can get is the auto mode and guide mode. Although the guide mode a little boring but still good and must have for starters. Without much hassle you can get great photos. The manual mode is very expansive. you can make almost any change to the settings you want. Stick to the basics and go on step by step , like first setting the aperture only , and then exposure etc and you are in the way of being a pro soon. Now about the accessories: Battery-- charges very fast and lasts long. Memory-- go for any size you like it depending on how much you shoot. Rest of the accessories are standard as the data cables, HDMi cables etc are sufficient. The ferrite cores provided are very useful put it on any data cable you are planning to use. Okay guys i hope you will find it somewhat useful. If you want more please comment. Last verdict : Buy it if it fits your budget and wish to use a DSLR
Nikon D3100 is the ebst DSLR in 30k range. I have been using it for close to 3 months now and can confidently write that I'm a very satisfied user and I didn't make a won choice. Who should go for Nikon D3100? > Anyone who is looking forward to taking their photography to a new level by moving up from a Point and Shoot or a Superzoom camera should go for D3100. No Superzoom can ever match DSLR quality. Superzooms offer better zooming option and a low price but their sensor size is too small to capture visually delighting pictures. Nikon D3100 comes with a 18-55mm VR lens that allows 3x zoom in point and shoot terminology. Pros: >A lot of Manual controls easily accessible from the body. >High ISO with minimal Noise. Nikon D3100 gives very clean pics at high ISO's. >Decent screen resolution, though a 920000 dots screen that comes with a D5100 would be even better. >Great in camera RAW pictures processing. one wouldn't need to do it on a computer. Its surprisingly faster in camera than in the computer. >Video capture in Full HD and 720p is very good, if not exactly close to HD Camcorders. Video capture is accessible from the body button >Very clear Optical viewfinder. >Very lightweight and good grip. >Surprisingly high battery capacity, I do over 450 shots at least. >I dont believe in Megapixels count really but the sensor size, something that really matters, is high, Its sensor is bigger than Canon counterparts which makes pictures crystal clear and complements the high Megapixels offered. Cons: >Live view mode isn't very pleasing, though I wouldn't use Live view ever, even if there was one that was better than what we currently have. Photo Capture is slower with Live view. Since i do not use Live view and would never use one, the absence of swivel screen that comes with D5100 doesn't hurt, it's more like a style feature than something of utility. >I don't really find the Guide mode very useful. I wonder if anybody is so dumb that they cannot learn photography without using the guide mode. I don't use the guide mode, even though I'm a beginner. >3fps is not the fastest you get. If you want a marginally faster camera with same picture quality, then spend about 8k more and get D5100. >The free bag that comes with Nikon DSLRs isnt that best bag you'd like to have your DSLR in. It's cheap. I'd buy a new bag for my DSLR soon. >4 GB card is insufficient for a whole day of photo capture, esp when you capture in RAW mode. I suggest going for a 16GB card, coz in my opinion, changing card is a pain when you are happily shooting, isn't it?
