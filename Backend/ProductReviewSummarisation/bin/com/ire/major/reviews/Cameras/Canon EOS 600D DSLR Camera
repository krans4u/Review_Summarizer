Canon EOS 600D DSLR Camera@@@now it has become a trend that students are into dslr and making photography as hobby using this camera since last month and feeling it.
I looked at the 550(T2i), the 600(T3i) and 60D and the 2 things that made me go to the 60D were price and fit/finish. For only $100 more (for body only) I got a package that fit my hands better. The price for the T2i (currently $649 body only) is compelling but I wanted the articulating screen. I think the T3i would be a good purchase as a first DSLR or a backup to the 7D or 5D.
After a long research on Sony, Nikon among this i have bought the Cannon600D Camera . Price comparison was so great and the features of 600d is greater than any other product. I suggest the product Canon600d for entry level photographers. It enables tremendous manual function to learn deep level manually operate the device to the learners. Great product one fantastic model forever....
Awesome camera reasonable price tag. And flipkart delivery was the fastest got it delivered in just 4 days thank you flipkart
The camera is very handy and worth in the performance . . . I am a begginer to the DSLR and have good grip over the point and shoot photography . . . I thought to do my photography a level up with DSLR by upgrading to it, its so amazing shooting with this monster, the only cons is the video recording where you will find autofocus a trouble and that too can be minimized with manual focusing and i recommend to upgradu your lens to telezoom if you love zooominggg and having a closeup of far target . . . I recommend this and this monster will never make you compromise with its performance . . . Thanks to the flipkart for great product on a great deal . . . The best camera at this price and if you want you can have nikon 3200 if you trust only nikon, i have grip on canon so i prefer this and if you are other fan of any company, no matter this product gonna satisfy to the mark of its promise . . . This is my 41st day of journey with my camera . . .
It's a good product.good quality.i want to learn from this camera.. i thought canon eos 600d slr better for me becoz it's have 18 MP . lot of people says this is good and professional camera. that's i bought this .. hope it's more helpful to me..for do the wonders.
smooth animation capabilities for amazing visuals and excellent navigation. smooth animation capabilities for amazing visuals and excellent navigation.
I bought this camera a week ago from Flipkart.Its very easy for a first timer.The Full auto mode is a great help if you are a beginner.This camera just feels rights in your hands.There is always the Never ENDING debate of NIKON vs CANON.Choose the one which feels right to your hands.For me the most favourite point of my camera is surely the Screen.It can be tilted in any angle.and opens a lot of creative shots.I find myself mostly shooting in the Live view mode.However this said the 18-55 lens which comes with this camera is not enough.You need to buy a zoom lens or a prime lens in future as the kit lens is not suited for all types of pictures. The battery backup of this camera is good.the picture quality is also good.I bought this camera for 27K(A Holi offer) And now the price is back to 32 K.:P Buy wisely.And keep clicking.:)
Ordered Canon 600D which arrived as within the stipulated time promised by Flipkart. Packaging was very good containing all the accessories as provided by Canon
Flipkart has given a offer saying 8GB SD card as free. That is of no use. Plz don't accept that. It has a speed of only 15MB/s. But this camera requires a speed of nearly 30MB/s. Otherwise the delivery and the camera are awesome enjoy!!
Very nice camera for beginners till one becomes expert in using it. However its better if we buy along with any other lens other than the kit lens to explore more and gain expertise in using the DSLR.
Excellent product.Performance approx. equal to the nikon d3200 and 5100.Buy it with "no confusion"...
You must have seen N number of reviews on the product as such and hence I'm not boring you with the same again. I'm highly satisfied with the Quality of the product and I recommend that you go for it without any hesitation as such, it is definitely worth the price tag which it comes along with. For a beginner like me this is definitely one of the best products out in the market. The service quality of WS Retail deserves a special mention too, they made a promise and stuck to it, in fact I received the product before the said date. Currently I'm try out various tricks with my new cam, and no it doesn't disappoint me in any way, I got what I paid for though I seriously wish that I had an extra lens. The 18-55mm kit lens does have it's limitations, I'm waiting to get my hands on a Extra Zoom lens with IS. Final word - GO FOR IT, WORTH YOUR PENNY!
Product good :), service timing good :), packing very bad:( :(. well this would be the jest of my review regarding the experience with buying this product. 1)Well to start with , the product is definitely a good bargain for amateurs at this price range, it might not beat it's expensive and high profiled cousins, however a good product. 2) I placed my order on 28th Feb and an estimate of 5 days was given for the delivery of the product. Well it was delivered one day in advance. 3) And now for the problem part of delivery, i was rather surprised to see that the package was tied above the silencer of the delivery bike. i mean how can a sane delivery person tie a package of precision and delicate item to his bike silencer. Anyhow i happened to take the package, hoping the packaging done by flipkart is always up-to the mark and to my dismay the packing inside was much lower then expected. cost cutting is necessary but not always. Don't look on for small gains which in turn will back fire and dent your reputation.
The camera is great as said by many, but flipakrt does it the right way in delivery thats why a big thumbs up to flipkart
Very Good Camera with lots of Features.
I ordered this camera from flipkart at 30.5k, and it was delivered very promptly in efficient packaging. After using it for almost a month now, I find it to be a sound choice. There are several compatible lenses for this camera, and the body itself is sturdy enough to be durable and last long. My initial buying dilemma was between Nikon D5100 and this one. You can't go wrong with either of the two. Both are equally capable models. Coming to the Canon 600D, the following are some of my observations: 1. The Camera performs well in all modes, with no noticeable degradation of IQ between 18 and 55mm. It starts up lightening fast. By the time you flip the on-switch and look through the viewfinder, it will be ready. 2. The camera has been designed with large hands in mind. I am able to hold it very comfortably. 3. There are extra buttons on the back that prove very useful when quick changes are needed. 4. Focusing is slightly noisy, but reasonably fast. 5. Contrary to so many reviews, I have confirmed that there is NO inbuilt AF motor. This matters very little anyway, as almost all Canon Lenses come with in built motors. 6. It is recommended to use the viewfinder with this model (if you are not already accustomed to this). There is a live view mode available, but it is not at all the way to use a dSLR 7. The Articulated display is a god-send. Has proven very useful in many situations (when using live view, or to set up the shot at odd angles) 8. The battery is quite capable of taking 600-700 shots in one cycle (provided you dont waste too much power reviewing each shot and using live view). There are many more things that I could put here, but that would be redundant, as they are already there in several other reviews. All in all, this is an awesome camera to start with for Amateurs, and can be used for intermediate and even professional photography.
excellent camera with awsome features, proper price, awsome speed delivery by flipkart. Used this and i'll say i'm totally satisfied
Canon cameras are excellent, once can click very nice clicks .One should know how to use it.Even my brother is using same.Excellent product and quality.
I had been so confused after checking out so many models in the market. But I finally decided to buy Canon 600D, and so far I feel that it was a wise choice. If you are a beginner and looking for a DSLR budget camera, THIS IS THE ONE!! Thank you flipkart for such speedy delivery and awesome packaging.
This is really a very good camera guys, everything is perfect it in. The only thing I though this camera falls short of is in it Viewfinder, its a pentamirror and not a pentaprism, but it will only matter to people who use viewfinder more then the LCD display, for other this should not be a big deat all... This is a brilliant camera guys and ofcourse an amazing service from flipkart too, go for it ....
Brought this product recently after so much research. Asusual flipkart delivery and the way they packed the product was mindblowing. Just a month old need to play a lot. Go for it guys.
well.. well.. well.. i bought dis cam few weeks back. flipkart as usual hats off to your delivery service. really happy with the product, good for beginners.
Got a good deal on Flipkart which included some essential accessories including carry bag, lens cleaner, additional memory card, tripod, etc. Flipkart even gave me credit through Wallet for future use because the price of the bundle reduced about a week after I purchased it! The cam itself is outstanding and one of the best picks for beginners. There are a number of advanced features to ensure you are happy even after you graduate to the intermediate level. Just buy additional lenses as you get better at DSLR photography and want to experiment. With the price coming down this cam gives amazing value for money.
I bought it some 6 months back and as a beginner its fantastic, just have to get one more zoom lens with this to serve all purpose. Got in good delivery condition from flipkart !
I have bought this camera from flipkart and got 5% cash back on it. I also got many accessories along with it, like the dust remover, blower, UV ray filter, tripod, 4GB memory card. This camera is real good for the people who want to learn photography. you can take nice photos using this. I would like to rate it a 5 star product. I got this product within 3 days of order and in excellent condition. And it is a complete camera with which you can work professionally to some extent.
i purchased it on a deal... n i got half of the money back..:) so happy for that... n cam its awesome... clarity is too good... n i got a stand n lens cleaner n a lans free for it...yay yay!!!!
this Camera is great i loved this camera. I am a starter for the photography. I wanna buy this camera is there any EMI options for 24 months. If there is an optin then can you explain me how the amount should be paid. if the is not an option for 24 months please explain the bank procedure for 12 month EMI.
I have been using this camera without any issues since last one year. It has infact been a pleasure using this product. I have used this camera on holidays, parties, with family and I have got exceptionally good photographs. This camera is user friendly and produces good quality pictures.
it is the man behind the machine who matters but it doesnt hurt to have a capable machine. The flip screen is certainly a big plus. The canon vs nikon debate is everlasting but just go for whatever you decide and if this is your choice then you wont regret it one bit.
First of all I want to clear that I am not a professional photographer instead love to shoot occasionally. The photo quality of the SLR is awesome and is perfect for any starter. 18-55 lens is pretty fast and IS works amazingly accurate. Low light images are also perfect with least noise. The colour reproduction is rich and balanced and gives a natural look to pictures. Going through camera settings is butter smooth and one can easily do whatever settings he/she wants. I have bought 55-250 lens as well separately but I must admit it is quite slow in terms of setting the focus and sometimes it is cumbersome taking pics with this lens. A perfect camera for me.
The first reason for writing this review is that even i read a number of reviews before buying a SLR and they really helped me a lot, so i hope that even my Review would help many of you to take a sound decision. A couple of moths back,i hardly knew anything about SLRs. what i knew was that i had to buy one. After a deep research i finally shortlisted Canon eos 600d and nikon D3200. Both cameras are equally good, and i finally chose Canon eos 600d on the basis of reviews and advice from my friends. its a great cam for the beginners i must say and i would like to thank all those whose reviews helped me. > Megapixels hardly matter in SLRs. so a 18mp canon can perform equally good like nikon 24mp > eos 600d has a rotatable screen which is a useful feature which nikon d3200 does not has. > in a 30k budget, this is the best cam. This info is more than enough for beginners. just buy this cam,,read tutorials on the net,,watch some fundamental videos on youtube and start clicking.... And on flipkart,i got one of the best deals for this cam. in the begining,to be true, i was pretty confused and scared regarding the genuinity of the product,but its all gud!!!! had a good shopping experience.
i am using this camera from last 6 months...on basis of i can say that is the best camera at price..excellent ergonomic.........great image quality......and better videos quality than many professional video cameras even with kit lens.......
Quite happy with this product ..... but quite disappointed with this when i saw again that its comes with dual kit with 36k ... and i brought this with 32k with single kit.... could you please replace it for the same... i will pay 4k extra ..
Even though this falls under semi professional category . I feel beginners will start to love photography with this . I have been using this since 3 months and I dont see any cons as such when we compare with its counterparts . Canon is THE BEST for motion photography and NIKON for still photography. Both are leaders in their own vertical . Flipkart delivery... I would like to rate 6 / 5 :) for their timeliness and packing.
A must buy camera for people who have just started getting interest in photography and believe me you would love it.Everything about this product is good right from unboxing.Kudos to the flipkart team to deliver it before time.
I bought this camera a month back. Not from Flipkart though. I have Clicked more than 1.5k pics. If anyone is ordering this cam make sure you go for the dual lens kit. as you start using the camera you will miss the zoom and buying 55-250 lens separately will cost about 16k. i made the mistake of buying it without dual lens and eventually had to shell out more money to get the extra zoom. Coming to the camera. 1) Autofocus : If you are used to a Point and shoot or a Superzoom camera you will love the Focusing system of DSLR. It focuses extremely fast compared to any super zooms or point and shoots out there. A tip for new users. please try to use the central autofocus point. you can manually select it. 2) Build quality : Dslr's are meant to last and canon 600d is no exception. 3) Video quality : This is on area where canon 600d is ahead of Nikon D5100. If are stuck between Nikon D5100 and Canon 600d i would suggest you to pickup Nikon d5100 if your budget is between 25k to 27k. if's a great cam with marginally better image quality than 600d. The only area where it lacks is the support for old nikon lens like the affordable nikon 1.8 prime( 6k) and somewhat inferior video quality compared to canon. Canon has increased the price of 600d by around 2k so effective market price of Canon 600d is around 32- 34k and in my view Nikon D5100 is more VFM than canon 600d.you will save a good 5 - 7k which can be invested in better camera bag and other things. Im not sure how the Nikon free bag is however the one that is sold with 600d is below average. it neither has good padding or space. I had to buy lowrpro 170.
When compared with other similar price and range cameras Nikon D5100 wins Pros: In built focus motor resulting for ability to focus will most of all the chip lenses. means need to spend less money if planning to buy many lenses Cons: only 1 cross type focus point Price is much more based on the features only twin lens kit is worthy to buy If somebody is planning to buy only basic 18-55mm kit only and not planning to buy more lens, then its better to go with nikon D5100 its very cheap when compared and also have overall better rating even better than 60D. Personally I was planning to buy many lenses so going for nikon is expensive option in this range. So, this one only comes to my budget ~40,000 INR.
I am writing this review after purchasing this camera one month back and using it for last 1 month. As already mentioned in earlier posts this camera takes great pictures. The features provided are decent (I personally use the manual feature, have not used the presets quite often). The Auto+ feature is really very nice. The feel of 600D in hand is quite good, it is bigger then Nikon models of the same range. Low light photography is not as good as Nikon. After 3200 ISO you will see noise. The video mode is fantastic in 600D, you have full control on the functions. With this camera and a good software you can easily make a short flim. I do not see any limitation on 600D. The colors are vibrant and detailed. I have shifted from canon s5IS (semi slr). So, missing the long zoom lens of s5IS (as I have only the kit lens). I would like to discuss about the 18-55 kit lens (as I have not found any detailed description of the same). If you are shifting from any semi-slr cameras or long zoom camera you will not get any zoom nearer to them in 18-55 kit lens. Having said so, you will still have some decent zooming experience. I believe, the kit lens takes best portrait shots at 50mm (my personal feeling, might be wrong). So, incase you are taking a portrait shot, try to keep it at 50 mm and adjust your position. The lens smooth when you move from 18 to 55. It is a bit noisy when using the AF (auto focus). As it has 18mm, you will have a very good wide angel for shots. I have got full Taj Mahal shot from quite near. In general, it is a good lens which takes decent photographs. Personally I feel you should have 18-55 lens in your collection if you do not want to invest in 2 - 3 different lenses. Again, if you want to make video use the kit lens at 50mm (If you do not want to buy the 50mm prime lens also known as plastic wounder.) The lens takes good video. Overall 600D is fantastic for beginners as first dslr camera. Use the kit lens to set your hand on dslr. There are lots of features which will keep you busy for few months. Regarding flipkart delivery (ws retail for my case) has been pleasant. Took few days to reach me. Packing was very good and the free accessories on the offer was also very good. One final note if you are not getting a dslr bag with the camera, please don't forget to buy the same.
This Camera which comes from a reputed brand , it costs many bucks to people pocket. As there are some cool phones % cameras launched by Panasonic in recent days like T11 , P51 and LUmix . I'm opting for them as they comes with cool offers too.
"Canon" all comes in the brand name, no doubt. I'm using this for last 18 months without any trouble or unsatisfaction. Great DSLR,build quality is awesome,responsive. Great buy. Anybody want to start their career in Photography or its hobby,you should buy this camera without any doubt. I suggest you along with this camera you must have Canon nifty-fifty prime lense (50mm 1.8f), 18-55mm & of course 70-300mm Tamaron Macro Di LD Zoom lense to kick start your passion...Go ahead,truly said best buy..
This is the DSLR for a mid-beginner. Go for the additional 50mm 1.8f lens along with this, which helps in shooting portrait and indoor photography. As a beginner, its mostly the indoors where the cameras are most used. Only after few hundred shots you can decide additional lens for your kit. To start off the 18-55 is more than enough (along with 50 mm 1.8f .. if possible). Flipkart as usual was excellent in its delivery. I got it in 3 days time.
The closest competitors in Cannon are none while in Nikon, there's D5100 and D3200. Well, first thing. Give anyone who owns a Nikon, they will accept without doubt that the Cannon UI is more user friendly. This actually helps when you are in a situation to capture a rare pic and you don't have much time to adjust manual settings. Nikon D3200 pictures comes with a yellowish haze under fluorescent light. That's actually annoying. Nikon D5100 has built in HDR which is good. Cannon lenses (55-250 IS)are cheaper compared to Nikon (75 - 300 VR) D3200 comes with a 24mpx sensor while this one has 18. D5100 has 16 MPX. Though its not a big concern anywhere. It is better if you have higher MPX for a perfect shot. Video quality is pretty good with Cannon, (useless info if you want just the pictures). Overall, a combination of 5100 and 3200 would be the perfect one. But since it does not exist, we go for something that's marginally less in a few aspects. If you are looking for a specific application for your SLR, you may go for 3200 or 5100. Otherwise Cannon would be a wise choice. PS: Just see the prices for Cannon 55-250 IS lens before purchasing. You will need it for sure. The question would be whether to go for it later or buy it immediately. Whichever works out cheaper, go for it.
In Flipkart, I read one review - You can buy Canon 600D plus 2 lenses 18-55 II and 55 - 250 II for 34,500 from local store, before you buy this camera, go check your local dealer once. Hope this will help you.
My first DSLR and I still remember how long it took me to reach to this decision. I went through almost every camera in this price range. I have friends who are professional photographers and even they helped me buy this camera. Canon 600D offers you a titling screen which is an asset for sure. Not to forget, the comforting grip points on the rear as well as the front, ensure that you have a strong and sturdy grip on the camera. The 18-55 mm wide angle lens is a starter's lens which will help you click everything. From portraits to landscapes to even street photography. Though I do recommend getting a 50mm prime lens (priced 7,000 right now) along with this camera. Prime lenses deliver quality which can only be experienced. Anyways, the battery backup is awesome. One full day of clicking still leaves you with some battery to view the pics on your way back home. Video shooting is excellent. Auto focus is a pure charmer and with the right memory card you can shoot everything from TVCs to short films to documentaries and even feature films (trust me, I have a Master's degree in journalism n mass communication). The camera comes with a BnW mode as well. The flash is more than capable of getting clear photographs in the dark. Although getting a lens hood is recommended. Now when I got this camera, I got a tripod stand which I fell in love with almost instantly. Family photographs, long exposure shots or simply standing in my room hooked to the tripod... the camera offers so much once paired with the tripod. The camera came with a bag, Canon camera strap, lens cleaner, two memory cards (4gb and 16gb, offers keep changing) and a tripod stand. I have journeyed with this camera up in the hills and even in the plains. It is an awesome camera and I would more than recommend it. Have a great time clicking!! :)
It is my first DSLR, and i can say it is best in this range, better then Nikon 5100, with whom it is compared most, You can easily get all the difference between two from may sources, they are almost similar in most of the aspects, The only thing which is better in Nikon 5100 is more preset modes. Its picture quality is very good, so go for it.
Become Professional Photographer... This is what will happen when u begin to use this product...Great experience But you will have to study a lot about photography for taking good pics All the difficulties i faced was because of my inability to use the setting properly and chose correct mode. Try with different settings and mode and u'll learn fast My Brother-in -law uses cannon 7D....now after he taught me...both the cameras r taking identical pics Remember 1 thing...50mm/1.8f lens is must if you want to see its true potential of blurred background( portrait photography)...or it is just like any other point shoot camera like coolpix (sorry for such comparison,but this is what will happen) 55mm-200mm/5.4f lens is good for landscapes and family pics only... Tamron 80mm-300mm macro is good and cheapest lens in this segment for macro pics(flower close-ups...i also shot full moon using tripod!!!) Thanks to Flipkart for such great offers
Thanks to Flipkart & WSRETAIL.. Packaging was perfect and delivery as committed. I was Bit Hesitant to order Expensive Cameras online, looking at the other reviews i made my mind to proceed with ordering. Boy o boy, it was to my expectation and the very happy. I need not comment anything about the camera as there arelot of reviews by users and its best entry level camera... Flipkat and WSRETAIL, stick to their offers & Freebies committed.. Thank you
I got this with 15% offer rate and I really appreciate flipkart for delivering it before 24 hrs. When we comes to cam, its really superb for beginners to learn alot in photography, nowadays I am spending more time with this new frnd. Free carry case which has given is not much worth, tats only drawback with this deal.
This an awesome camera and having a great value for money. Pair it with good quality lens and here you go..great professional shots.
Hi All, Like everyone I have used few point and shoot cameras. This is my first Dslr camera and I should say it really changed the way my photo looks. Every time I take it out I am learning something new. I bought it for 29500 from flipkart and this offer is a combination of seller and citibank offer. When enquire for the best camera for beginners this is the name that was suggested by everyone. Battery lasts for nearly 500 shots. This is a must have to capture the best moments. The kit lens in pretty good, still I would suggest you to get the body and a better lens. Manoj
I bought Canon EOS 600D with EFS18-55mm IS lens kit from Flipkart in June in 30550/-. Got pretty fast and I rate that experience as excellent as I got some freebies from WS Retail and at that time it was a coolest buy. And Canon rocks! In October second week, I bought my second lens EFS 55-250mm IS in 16500/-. Got slightly late but lens is pretty awesome. And Canon rocks! Now when I came to know about prices on other sites, I feel a bit cheated. How come there is a difference of more than 2500/- on a frequently sold lens!! also coupled with some over-advertised offers its not a best buy in terms of pricing. Also EOS 600D double kit lens (EFS 18-55 mm IS and EFS 55-250 mm IS) is available at three other sites and I must say those three sites are giving coolest deal (~38000/- to ~39000/-) on this camera. Canon itself is giving in 41k with cashback on cards. So only because of pricing point of view I am rating it 4/5. Else camera, lens and delivery are excellent. Other guys have already written plenty of pros/cons. For beginners-and-to-be-serious folks, its excellent. Please rate/comment if you have felt the same, especially who have bought this b/w June and October.
Well, this is not to critisize Flipkart services as, in the past, I got some excellent deals and delivery from Flipkart. So, kodos to their overall services. Coming back to this product ... I was eyeing to buy Canon EOS 600D for quite sometime. Did a lot of research and based on my needs, zeroed in on this brilliant camera. Unfortunately, the lowest offer in Flipkart says that the seller does not ship to my address which is in Navi Mumbai. I didn;t understand why it was so. Anyway, after checking prices online, I went to Jumbo electronics on Dassera day and checked the price. They were offering me this camera (w 18-55 IS lens) at Rs. 35885/- They initially offered to give free bag and a tripod. I didn;t need a tripod, so I negotiated with them to give me a class 10 SD card. I got a SanDisk Class 10 32 GB card as a freebie. Finally got the entire stuff for Rs. 35000/- So, overall it turned out to be a better deal than Flipkart. Hence went with the deal. As for the camera, clicked a few pics with it on that day itself ... and I have to admit, it is really a class camera. The pics come out really good and sharp. The Canon IS lens does perform very well. The pics take a while to get registered ... but I guess thats because I was using the in-kit class 4 SD card. Now, I have a 350D and clicked some good pics with it in the past. But, in that, I had to do lot of adjustments/settings to get a real good pic. This camera, I found that, with the base settings only, I am getting great pics. Pics at low loght was also soming out really well. I haven't tried the video option, but I read from many blogs that this has great video qualities as well. Very happy with the camera and hope to enjoy photography more with it. My suggestion to all out there ... invest in this, if you want to learn photography OR if you are a casual photographer like me.
This camera is simply the best for beginners. The manual itself will guide you through the basics of photography.One thing that i like is the build quality ans the flip screen. Build quality is far better than 1100D and other nikon products in the range. I even drenched the camera in the rains still no problems :-). Go for this if you like to record video as well. 4/5 for this incredble camera
i think why d price z around 35k for dis camera ...... whatever facility it z giving its camera normal features>>>>>>>.
HI, I really happy on camera delivery. Got the camera, before their promise date.. packing was superb and also offer's too nice... regards gkhegde
hey guys if u r planning to buy this camera then please dont expect a good zoom from this.. it offers a very small zoom.. but the picture quality is very very good... u will be really happy with its picture quality but zomm is equally bad.. this camera can best be used in rainy or winter seasn.. an overall good choice to buy this..
If u want to start ur DSlr Photography,then this product is pefect. If u don't know anything about handling of dslr then u will surely learn in depth with 600D,Believe me(coz i was in that stage :P) I found it user friendly.many additional features than 550D and 1100D! So go ahead and buy this..been using for almost 4-5 months and results are fab. (Y) (Y)
It was a great challenge for me to select a camera which gives me a smooth accessibility over its awesome controls/settings. Like everyone else I was also confused between Canon 600d and Nikon 5100. I took almost one month to review both of them and then made my turn for Canon. Below are the reasons for which I went for 600D- 1. Previously I used Canon SX150IS which gave me a good amount of manual control with the limited feature of a compact camera. I believe that experience also forced me to go for 600D. 2. I also went to a shop to check their physical built and to be honest with you everyone should try this before buying a DSLR. Canon 600D felt very comfortable to hold in my hands. It is slightly bigger than 5100. This was also a driving factor. 3. Last but not the least was the Auto focus feature. Canon DSLR has this feature in their body(entry to high end model), where as Nikon provides it in lens for entry level models. Some more points you should consider before purchase- 1. Canon and Nikon has their own ecosystem for lenses. Third party lenses are also available for both. If you are thinking to take your photography to next level then you should study your options. As the kit lens will not do 100% justice to the camera sensor in terms of quality. 2. Please do not fall for Megapixel gimmick. As a beginner you would hardly take A4 prints of your photos. For that both of the cameras has good amount of MP. Just remember on APS-C sensor higher resolution could end up with nasty image noise. Both cameras are awesome and comparing them according to technical specification would do no justice. Each having some strength or weakness compared to other. But both of them can deliver mesmerizing images. So go for the one which makes you feel like it is an extension of your creative part. I choose Canon as I felt the same. Thank you Flipkart for awesome delivery. Packaging was very good. The camera was delivered within the next day of purchase.
Flipkart delivered this camera within one day with an excellent packing. It is a very good camera for beginners, very easy to handle the settings and functionalities and it has premium features too. Very good output. Thanks to Flipkart.com. I love to shop on flipkart.
The Canon 600D is the best buy for the budget conscious who want's to explore the world of photography, as a first line of products in this category Canon has designed one of the best camera's with robust build and smooth handling the amount of features offered is quite at large, for all those wanting to jump into SLR photography with budget in mind this is the best proven camera available in the market, the packaging is quite good and delivered in time from flip cart merchant.
Once again, I could afford a camera as cool as this. Thanks to FlipKart's offer and the no extra charges emi scheme. I ordered the camera at around midnight and had it at my door in a couple of days. The camera is an excellent one and it has some awesome pictures that make clicking easy and enjoyable
Was confused between, 5100 and 600D, eventually bought the canon as it was easier to use, felt less plasticky and had a cheaper 50mm 1.8 option. The trade offs being out right IQ and dynamic range. Pros 1. Easy to use 2. Feels good in large hands - unlike nikon 3. Macro option in lens kit 4. Good sharp JPEG out of the box 5. Larger view finder Cons 1. Outright RAW image quality is better on the Nikon (better sony and toshiba sensors) - Rarely of significance in non professional / hobby shooting. 2. Any image above ISO 1600 looks like sandpaper !!! (advantage-nikon) - If low light performance is needed, go for a full frame. 3. Slow autofocus in live view - Forget using the display - Use the view finder If I had the budget I would have gone for Nikon D7100. 600D seemed to me as a better pick btwn 5100 and Canon 600D
I got Canon EOS 600D SLR 3rd days of ordering, Camera and picture quality is excellent. the intelligent mode is easy to use and very effective. Packing was done by professional packers so no chance of damage. This was my 5th buy and let me tell you Flipkart product are original and service is good and quick responsive. I got lot of free items like Tripod and 8 GB memory card from Flipkart. So guys its Indian Flipkart and go for it.
If your entering into the world of photography, this is the best choice. There might be other cheaper alternatives. But this one is very impressive. At times i felt auto focus is not at its best, other than that i have no complaints. For the price range it offers you everything needed.
I was happy to have my 1st dslr camera, but it was a damaged product, any way i called up flipkart and they have initiated a replacement , but the action was taken after 2days only. Any way, the camera is sturdy and with good quality, its light weight and is user friendly. To tell nikon 5200 and 5100 is very good for portraits and all, but canon d600 is also very good, pixels are too awesome, u will love it when you have it in your hands.Video quality "hats off", nothing can compare with it.Some say auto focus is not that good, for my experience, its the fastest when u just click the motor works in less than a sec, Overall , i will say to everyone, u can buy this without any doubt, i guarantee you, u wont regret it.
I recently bought EOS 600D from WS retail. Very happy about the service and the product. Received the product much before the estimated date. Excellent price!!!!!. Excellent service!!! Excellent delivery!!! Waiting for the freedom offer lucky draw results :)
Thank you FlipKart. You never cease to amaze me. I have been a regular customer with FK right from the time they offered only Books. Never had any problem. Got the product within 24 hrs(from Delhi to Bangalore) How do you do it! About the product: I spent hours on internet, reading through articles, reviews and videos. I had a tight budget and wanted the best possible machine. This is an upgraded version of the popular 550D. I have just started to play with this beauty and I am already in love. If you are planning to get your first DSLR, look no further and go for it.
I am waiting for the dual lens kit offer i love to buy. Very good service from flipkart...got things in 2 days. This is a very good camera for beginners. Produces very good quality pics. Value for money. Advise everyone to read the documentation that came along with the camera well - helped me a great deal.

All credits goes to my cousin and canon. Thank you...
Very good service from flipcart...got it in 2 days. This is a very good camera for beginners. Produces very good quality pics. Value for money. Advise everyone to read the documentation that came along with the camera well - helped me a great deal.
It is a dream come true for me!!! I am very impressed by the bullet speed delivery . I would like to give a new title for Flipkart i.e "FASTKART".Lastly i need to make a point that the combo offer which i got for CANON 600D was really classic!!!!!One blindly trust flipkart and very good packing.
PROS Good for beginners..... Nice & Chunky to hold in hands..... Nice & crisp videos.... CONS Camera fells imbalance if using telephoto lenses.... Wheather profing in missing.... People with small hands go for nikon....
Okay, so I normally do not prefer purchasing the product which is above 10K from the on-line shopping store but i took the chance with the DSLR camera and my experience with very good. 1. Fast delivery - I almost got the camera in two days which is way too fast than other shopping site. 2. Great packaging - It took me hours to open the package :) There was air packets to provide the safety of the product which is very decent. Thanks to flipkart. 3. Great Camera - However I got the kit lens which is not that good when you do a Macro Photography and the pictures are not that dramatic so you mostly will go for F1.8 50mm but for starting and learning the photography this is indeed a great stuff. thanks Flipkart - Keep up the god Job !
I bought this camera bundle from WS retail about a month or so ago. Firstly I would like to state that I chose this camera after a lot of research before-hand and on use I am not disappointed even in the least! The 600D is a definite winner! PROS: 1. The scene features and shooting features are many more than the predecessors, giving a wider set of tools to the photographer. 2. The swivel LCD screen is exceptionally clear and does justice in terms of contrast of the taken picture, on transferring the pics I found that there was no or negligible difference in the contrast displayed. The fact that it can be turned in different directions enables for self portraits, event shooting over crowds etc. 3. the construction of the camera body is good, not excessively heavy and has a textured non slip kind of surface, I found that single hand shooting also felt pretty secure. 4. the in kit 18-55 lens is good for medium depth and macro photography though due to its minimum aperture, indoor photography and low light photography tends to look dull, daylight photography is beautiful. The ONLY concern that I have is in the joint of the swivel LCD screen, it turns a full 180 only in one direction and 90 in the opposite direction, if by chance excess force is applied twisting in the wrong direction the screen might snap, so except for a little caution when handling it there's no other issue as such. All in all its a worthy buy, definitely recommend it for beginners, amateurs and semi-professional photographers. Regarding the service : Flipkart did an amazing job of very securely packaging the camera and accessories bundle with lots of bubblewrap etc. I got the package within 36 hours.
This is the best camera in its class, fully loaded for professionals and equally easy for novice. very good results even with minimum knowledge of photography. easy to handle. very very sturdy. I also got freebies like 8 GB card, tripod and bag.
Best in class camera. Best in class lens. Best in class low light clicking. Best for this price Flipkart offering. Get this entery level DSLR and start clicking because there's lot to learn after you get a DSLR in hand.! Nikon OR Canon, Buy any. In this price range whether its Nikon's D3000, D3100, D3200, D5000 OR D5100 OR Canon's 550D, 600D. Every DLSR under 35k are all same. Try Nikon OR Canon, which ever you like in hand, Buy it in one shot. FLIPKART, YOU'RE AWESOME (as always)
Quick delivery from Flipkart. This one of the best entry level DSLRs. Its easy to use, beginners can just use auto mode and later on choose the professional settings. Swivel screen is great for shooting from different angles. Got a bag and 2 memory cards bundled. Was a good deal.
Pros 18-megapixel sensor, the same as in the 60D and the 7D Records full HD video at various frame rates Vari-angle 1,040K dot swivel screen is great for shooting in awkward positions USB and mini-HDMI output Compact form factor that doesn't feel cramped Excellent dynamic range for shooting in harsh lighting conditions Nice in-camera effects that can be applied to any photo Cons Video limit of 29 minutes and 59 seconds Significant noise in video in low light conditions Noise is prominent in photos shot at ISO 1600 and above No weather sealing Autofocus is unable to perform in lowlight
very good service from flipkart... got a combo with tamron 70-300 lenses. @ 37000. with bundle of accesories like.... camera bag, memory cards, two uv filters 57 & 62, tripod, lense cleaner etc.. all with super packing and good delivery.
Thanks Geoffrey, For such wonderful comparison, if such comparison can be made by Flypkart, that would be so awesome for us to decide. Like Nikon is 16 MP and Canon is 18MP and also the other feature comparisons. Anyways, thanks so much Geoff Vinay
courier service is very bad i have orderd two times ,my order has been cancelled after so many days i have order third time finally i got my product it took 9 days to delivered. .camera is excellent , It has Vari-Angle LCD screen which will make you to take pics at all angle ., This camera has a Video Snapshot function, . This Camera body is very nice and easy to use Has Good ISO levels ... there is a little bit of noise level when you go above 3200. This Video quality at this price is unmatched to anything ... the videos are really great ,18.0 Megapixels which is really needed for cropping .
If anybody want to buy this don't be confused, just buy it.., a good value for your money.........................................................................................................
I am planning to buy this camera since 1 month and the price is too high compared to amazon.in . But I am very loyal to flipkart. And I buy only on flipkart, because service is too good. But the price makes me a little unfaithful. It's tempting to buy the same product for cheaper price!!! Hope the price reduces..Why does the price fluctuate?
A nice piece of equipment. And as always excellent service from Flipkart. Received the product in just a day. Clean and New. Regarding the dslr model, sure you should know about it before you buy. The offer that comes with the camera is also reasonably good. The tripod isn't good enough for video mode, but can be used for still photography. Also bought a Tamron 70-300mm Di lens. Pretty good too.
Very good camera for starting a SLR experience.The flip out screen is fantastic. I actually use it way more than I thought I would.The HD Video is also brilliant. I am insanely pleased with my purchase....
I have been using FK for qyt a while now and im simply impressed by its services and customer's satisfaction. Its not only the satisfaction but also the delight. I completely trust that they offer genuine products. There are so many tempting offers that u simply cant find the best deal elsewhere.
Asusal before buying was confused btwn nikn 5100 and canon 600 d.. Finally went with canon as lens options are more and the basic thing that canon model is succesfull as compared to nikon 1 .. Flipkart service gr8 recieved in 2 days.. Got a realy gr8 deal at 30345..
Good service and never before price .I got this Cannon 600D within 1 day of time .Also 3k less from market with free gifts which is excellent.Major thing is that packing is gr8.Thanks to Flipkart and WS for this type of service with qualityl
Ordered Canon 600D with 10% discount on 10th June( Big Monday sale). And they delivered it in 3 days as mentioned. Camera and other freebies are in good condition. Details of freebies offered are : Tripod ( Simpex 333) Filter (Nisi 58 mm Ulta Violet Filter SDHC Card ( 16gb Sandisk class 4) , should have given a class 10 card Lens Cleaner ( Nisi Pro Lens Pen ) And a DSLR bag
Brand new and in good condition. Hoped to get the product on time but it took longer than promised. The product and the freebies are as mentioned. so far so good. no complaint in the product...............................................
Cam: EOS 600D is one good Cam if you are looking for a beginner level DSLR. Amazing features, easy to handle and very user friendly. The Cam is medium weight and gives you a good photography experience. I wont talk much about the product itself cause if you are planning to buy this I assume you already know how great this cam is. Flipkart: The best in class service. Delivered as promised. Amazing packaging and all contents mentioned on the site AS IS !! Overall a great buying experience & would prefer buying rest of the accessories from Flipkart. Cheers!
At first sight, I must say, This is a must buy for beginners. I know most of them will be confused on which one to buy EOS 600D or 1100D. I would suggest not to compromise on quality. This is way much better than 1100D. And what i liked the most was the freebies i got along with the camera. Along with a 4GB card they also gave me 16GB one free, a tripod, lens cleaner, UV filter,..and what not. Its the best deal for you to buy. Take my word, DO NOT THINK TWICE, buy it.
Its nice to have a dslr if u want to shoot people go for cannon otherwise go for Nikon for landscapes ..a suggestion if u have some more money go for 18-135mm lens not for 18-55mm ..And flipkart has delivered it perfectly same as the one we buy at a showroom without any damage..Its awesome product I have received it in two days after I have ordered flipkart is quick....
its actually worth buying it for tht money and also the big offers provided by the flipkart. But if u could afford to buy the kit number 2 then i suggest u to buy tht rather than buyin this For those ppl who are new to usin dslr, there is nothin to worry its very user friendly and compact. i suggest u to buy a new lens along with this for those who cannot afford kit 2 bocoz with this u would be gettin the base lens which is not good zoom lens.
Just wanted to give a short review about this great SLR camera. With Flipkart's pricing, I was way too confused between Nikon D5100 and Canon 600D - you can't go wrong with either of them, though Nikon's colors tend to be on the punchy side. Most prosumer grade DSLRs have a plethora of options and tricks, but all that matters the most is how you frame and compose your image. Based on my observations: 1. Image quality - excellent resolution 2. Image colors - a little dull (ever so lightly though) in default mode, but just tweak a notch up in custom picture settings, you'll be awed! 3. Burst speed - pretty good! I tried it with AI Servo focus mode on my 11 month old son always on the move, and the results are fantastic! 4. Image noise - yes, it's present at 1600 ISO, but why would you even shoot beyond 800 ISO in these mid-range DSLRs? 5. Build quality - Made in Taiwan, and feels pretty solid except for the SDCard and Battery doors. Would have been happier with a 'Made in Japan', but it's ok, we're a third world country! 6. 18-55 kit lens - I wish Canon gave a lens as sharp as the ones that come with Sony SLTs. No comparison here, the SLTs' kit lens are way better. It might sound subjective, but you be the judge 7. Video quality and options - awesome at this price point What could have been better? (note: these are not cons) 1. Auto focus on live view (contrast detect) - pathetic, and I'm more convinced to use the optical viewfinder :) 2. Missing proximity sensor under the view-finder (the 550D had this!!) 3. Mode dials do not rotate 360 deg. My Canon S5IS rotates perpetually, which is good 4. Bundling an HDMI cable would have been a nice touch Note 1: I didn't buy from Flipkart for 2 reasons. 1. Much lower price at a local store near my place. 2. Didn't want any of their freebies ('ll buy them separately, later) Note 2: WARRANTY registration on Canon Edge. When I tried to register my camera, it said 'Serial number not found'. I panicked and even went to the lengths of thinking that it could be a smuggled product as I bought for cheap :( Then after digging around, wrote a mail to admin@canonedge.com with a screenshot of my invoice, and I was able to register the product after 24 hours. @Kunal Puri - this answers your question? You can lower your eyebrows now ;)
THE PRODUCT: It was a toss up between the 650D and the older 600D and I finally went with the 600D after reading reams of pages and forums on the two cameras. I needed something for video that wouldn't break the bank and the Digic 5 on the 650D didn't convince me enough to shell out the extra cash. I'm happy to say I believe I made the right decision. The 600D performs beautifully, especially with a 64GB SDXC card thrown into the mix. I quickly added a 50mm prime lens and the results are sheer poetry. One week into receiving the camera I've already got two other colleagues to place orders for theirs. The rest of the good stuff on the 600D is amply available online and there's little else I can add that others on this page and elsewhere haven't already said. THE DELIVERY: I was sorely let down with this transaction. Maybe I have high expectations from Flipkart who've had a stellar track record with all my past transactions. So much so that I had switched from another popular online portal for all my purchases. The initial shipping estimate for the product was 5 days. This itself is too high at a time when retailers are delivering products in two days or less. Ironically, the web page for the product promises that it will be "Delivered in 2-3 business days". A day after the due date passed I was asked to wait another 3 days which is when I decided to cancel the order and just get my camera from somewhere else. I'm not sure whether to credit Flipkart with swinging into action and having the camera delivered that very day or to point a finger at them and say, your customer shouldn't have to come to cancelling his order before proactive action is taken. Either way, my rating here is for the product and not the service. Incidentally, while trying to register the camera online I was told by the website that the serial number is not recognised. Another reason to raise eye-brows?
thank you flipkart..!! service is great... i ordered my camera on wednesday night... and i got it within 48 hours... thank you so much.. love my canon... :) the packing was good... no worry about camera being broken or damaged.. the camera works great.. can't be any better... you made my day..
Starting with flipkart the packaging & the additional accessories given to it makes it a good deal. A nice Camera for Beginners with a no of features, definitely better than others in its class.canon has always been been known in producing good camera's. Nice Quality,with precision.I used this camera for a month & then reviewed it....An 55-250 lens makes it a beast... Don't go for 75-300 lens as its not stable,not a good lens at all...
Hi all, After doing lot of research I bought this camera. This camera is pretty decent for beginners. Its easy to use with the Auto mode even for an amateur.. But if you want to utilize the full power of the camera the manual mode is perfect ! With the IS lens your pictures won't go blurry even taking pictures at low shutter speed (without tripod).. I would say this is the perfect buy if you are planning for an SLR. However if you can extend your budget, I would suggest you to buy the body and some advanced lens. You can google on which lens to choose.. There are even thousands of yt videos on how to choose lens.
Flipkart is the best place to get this camera..ordered on saturday morning nd was delivered on Sunday eve..very impressive..packaging was perfect nd the freebeies are pretty awsum..so , beginners don't get confused between canon nd nikon, everything has it pros and cons..but Canon is far better than nikon..so definitely go for the 600D..nd p.s: flipkart is the best deal in market..happy shopping nd hav fun clicking fantabulous photos nd videos!!!:)
I didn't buy this camera in Flipkart ... but i wish to tell something about this camera . First i have planned to buy Nikon D5100 but i'm not a great Nikon fan .. i like Canon very much and the main reason y i buy this camera than Nikon is this camera has a Manual Control in Video where as Nikon as nly Auto mode. The reason why you have to go for Canon 600D are :- 1) It has Vari-Angle LCD screen which will make you to take pics at all angle . 2) This camera has a Video Snapshot function . 3) This Camera body is very nice and easy to use . 4) Has Good ISO levels ... there is a little bit of noise level when you go above 3200. 5) This Video quality at this price is unmatched to anything ... the videos are really awsome . more than that for those who like to take really good pictures and at the same time wanted to take nice videos .. this Camera is for YOU !!!
I placed my order on 6th may 12.00 pm and received the camera on next day 7th may 2.00 pm,,, I dont think so any other online portal(shopping site) doing like this... its really amazing... Now coming on to the camera, after a long long research review I finally decide to go with canon and last with this model Canon 600D. In this price what Nikon lacking.... 1. Wireless flash option. 2. You can customize the firmware.(Its like rooting the android phone to utilize some hidden feature.) 3. Inbuilt focus motor.(no need to spend much amount later on lens) 4. Approx 2 Lac more dots. 5. Little large view finder. and excellent HD video recording with mind blowing still image. I m writing this review on the same day, as I used 550d before(one of my friend using it)but 600d is the best. But I am not an expert photographer, but everyone knows no one can explain yourself better than you......
Big and heavy, can't recommend it. Makes pictures and all, yes, but, well, you see, it's just that I don't actually want to take pictures... :( I just need a big and heavy DSLR to walk around with, to complete my hipster outfit.
The canon 600D is an amazing camera to work with. The switches and buttons are pretty much self descriptive. The menu's are really convenient for a newbie. In any of the manual modes, it also pops up help text about each individual setting, also suggesting how the setting would affect the image. The camera feels sturdy yet light, but is not weather resistant. The kit lens is good enough to begin with and learn, but fast learners might grow out of the kit lens soon. All in all, a great buy.
Its pretty good for starters who want to taste the SLR technology. Although if you're an professional like myself, i advice you to go try the 7D. Anyway, the lenses are what matters more than the camera body, so this will definitely bang for the buck if you hve the right lens to play it with.
This is a review after a months usage, so here are the pros and cons. First, I would like to something which holds true about every DSLR or point and shoot or whatever camera devices out there. We are living in a time where actually difference between cameras is just feel and not quality and other things. All the cameras out there can produce brilliant images, if you know how to use them. Don't believe me? Go to Flikr, open camera finder and look at the stunning pictures taken from canon/nikon/pantex/olympus and even iPhone 4s/galaxy S3s and Nokia's. Don't be fooled when someone says "this camera can take good pictures", coz its the person behind the camera who takes the picture. Camera just prints it on the sensor or film. Now about the camera, 600D. It takes nice pictures. It has all the features a beginner should need, and then some when you grow as a photographer and add some thingamajigs it will let you. Picture quality is very good, if you have some good glasses then you can produce excellent images. Noise is there at high ISO, but which camera doesn't? Nikon is a bit better, but only when you see you images at 100% magnification, then only you can tell some difference. What to do? shoot in RAW and use software noise reduction (In-camera noise reduction can loose some details) I use Adobe lightroom 4.3, which has very good noise reduction algorithms. **Always shoot in RAW**. Or you can use lower ISO with lower shutter speeds. Flipkart gives you a free tripod, right? 2nd thing about in camera focus motor. No, conon does not have it. Shocking? Actually all the EF line series of Canon cameras have internal focus motors, so why you need and in-body motor? canon dumped their entire lens lineup in 1987, in favor of EF(and EF-S), where now in-body focus motor is not necessary. Nikons still have there pre-F mount..hmm.. bayonet mount ...err..whatever mount lens compatibility. Some of older lenses( like 50mm f1.8 D) which still require in-body focus motor, so they left it there. Now your choice...cheaper body and costly lenses, or slightly costly body and cheaper, but optically just as good, if not better(actually some are better), lenses. Nikon AF-S lenses are not costlier, actually many of the canon lenses are costlier. for example, canon EF 70-300 f4-5.6 USM IS lens is 46k on FK, canon is 35k something. Don't know which one is better though. I have used canon one, which is pretty good, not like L lens, but good. There are other way around examples as well. You see, you can debate your whole span of life which one is better, but people who take great pictures, go out in the field with whatever gear they have, and produce beautiful images. So choose whichever suits you, which feels good in your hand and start shooting. Make the best of the gear you have, even a Hasselblad or Leica is not perfect. Why I bought canon? 1.I had a budget, in which I felt this was the best model(Sadly they reduces the price the 3rd day I bought it) :(( 2. This one felt good in my hand, nikon was a little too small. 3. I have friends, who have canons, so I can borrow some lenses :D. This one can produce great images in good hands, and crap in bad. It doesn't do anything on its own. Happy snapping.
Well, Many of you may be confused as to which camera should be your first DSLR,two of the best in the market are Canon EOS 600D and its closest competitor Nikon D5100. Why the Nikon D5100 >A very complete camera with 1080p video feature(the video is not good) >Very good for photography at low light, less noisy(better than Canon) >Great image quality Why the Canon 600D >A camera which gives any beginner a taste of professional quality pictures >The camera give you a lot of professional features and total manual control hence experimenting is great >18.0 Megapixels which is really needed for cropping(Better than nikon) >Excellent video 1080p..far superior to nikon's >excellent build quality..far better than the nikon >Very Easy to use interface and controls..again better than the nikon D5100 >Presence of focus motor(hence more no of lenses) which is absent in the nikon D5100 The canon 600d is costlier than the nikon d5100, but in many ways its worth the extra money. Both are excellent cameras...Choose as per your need..
If you are not professional photographer, and your budget is slightly over 30k then this is the Camera you should own. I bought it from middle EAST but it is awesome! It is better to go for Canon if you would like to have comparatively low prices lenses and accessories.
This camera is very good for aspiring photographer's and filmmakers.If you are considering to buy the EOS 650d or Nikon D5200 or wait for EOS 700d then my opinion is you should buy the EOS 600d or Nikon D5100,the 650d and d5200 do have some eye-catching features but I compared the stills and video they shoot with those of there predecessors and I saw they have more or less the same image quality without any marginable difference so you should go for the 600d or d5100 it's upto you which you buy and with the money you saved i.e the massive 30k if you were going for 650d or the 15k if your choice was d5200 buy a prime lens(Believe me they are not to be missed)and get a zoom lens such as a 55-250mm or 70-300mm lens as the kit lens start to annoy when you would have learnt a thing or two about photography. Hope this review was helpful.
The cam is awesum ...i loved it .... its worth for its price n the deals r awesome ..m damn satisfied ...and its the perfect place to buy such things without wasting ur time n energy on reviewing anywhere else ;) And thanks flipkart and fedex for such good shipping with perfect packaging n delivery time ... n yes i recieved it two days before the promised date .... thanks again flipkart ..:) its just awesum ...::))
Delivery happened within 24 hours.. Super Happy.. with your delivery Flipkart.. Product in perfect condition.. Canon 600D speaks for itself.. Great portraits.. great landscape pictures... so far only experimented in these categories.. Probably the best camera for beginners.. go for it.. guys.. 10/10.. Accessories are of good quality.. A 16 GB memory card would have added cherry on the cake..
This is one of the best entry level DSLR's available in the market. For all those who are wondering whether to buy this or NIKON D5100 , Just don't think more! Go for this one. Every camera has pros and cons but this one has pros and only pros (cons are so minute that they can be ignored). If you have got interest in photography and you want to take it to the next level, then this is the camera you wanna see it in the delivery pack ! Go for it. Cheers !
canon 600d is best dslr for learning photography, its best cam in mid range segment with compare with other dslr, and hats off to flipkart i got delivery within just 48 hours with great packing lens cleaner, tripod, 32gb memory card is good but i'm disappoint with carry bag, i think i've to buy new bag to increase camera life, satisfied with service.
i am planning to buy 600d soon but i have a doubt regarding its video specifications. i just wanted to know whether it can shoot 720p videos at 60fps.i asked it mainly because am interested in slowmotion videos and many told me that 60fps is actually quite good for that.so those own this product please give a reply prety fast
This camera is just awesome. Has everything that a DSLR camera needs. If you are not a pro, this is the best you can get < 40K. And don't compare it with Nikon D5100 (almost same price), both are awesome. Neither will disappoint you.
Recently purchased my 600D from Flipkart. Delivery was quick despite the Holi weekend. The camera is extremely good and I need not dwell on that. What I was more concerned about was whether the bundled accessories were good. I called up the customer care to find out, but the rep could not tell me the brand of the accessories. But he assured me that these are of a reputed company. So I went ahead with my purchase. However, I was a tad disappointed with the tripod (Benro T-600EX) and very disappointed with the bag (unbranded). The package also includes a lens cleaner (Lenspen NLP-1), which I have not used and hence cannot comment on. But reviews suggest it's a basic lens cleaner. But the saving grace was the 32GB Sandisk memory card included in the package, which was a big surprise since the product description says the bundle includes a 16GB card. Thus, all in all, I think this is still a very good deal and I'm happy to have purchased it from Flipkart.
Believe me, !! had researched for about 6months to get an beginner DSLR, and of course its a decision between Canon EOS 600 D and Nikon D 5100 , stucked between them for almost half year,comparing blah blah !!! If you are a canon fan ( or if canon looks good to you , go for it) or else if you are a Nikon fan go for Nikon , or if you are not sure, then take a look at the both, if any lookwise feel good go for it , because, at the end of the day, your comfortable on things matters. both are same as hell , may be specs say this has that, and it doesn't etc , its all same Personally i felt canon eos 600d is good (this is my first buy in DSLR) or camera i say P.s. : Snapsort is a Nikon fan page, so dont get confused !! cameralabs seems to be neutral.i am not sure... so feel it buy it...no specs will give you a shit !!! Hope this helps
I have never handled a DSLR camera before, but wanted to buy one for a long time. So I had finally ordered it in Flipkart and it reached me in two days. I would say the camera's photographic quality is very excellent even in low light. The video had little pixel problems when I took one in low light. However, I later understood that by changing the settings accordingly, I could produce a great video even in low light because the same quality occurred in low light in Canon 550 D and 650 D too. So I would recommend this to everyone, especially to photographers and newbie filmmakers ! Thank you Flipkart for an excellent service.

Actually I was looking to buy EOS 550D but now it seems its no more available with basic kit I. So in place of it, I bought this one. This is really a nice camera, especially when you are learning the actual photography. It has nice guide Also this can come in handy for non-photographer as it also has modes like a point and shoot camera on top of DSLR photographic modes (so that someone can click u well ;) ). Result of the photographs is awesome. Worth the penny, and best for some newbie in photography. And Flipkart, their delivery is fast, very good packing as always and some really worthy schemes of 0 EMI.
Image quality: On Low ISO (100-400) image quality is Very good as expected. On moderately high ISO (800-1600) image quality is good and noise level is very low. On high ISO (3200+) image quality is quite good and noise level is also low but visible. So on my opinion this camera is very good response on light and better image processing. Video quality: I have not check this feature as I wanted this camera only for image shooting. Auto focus: On moderate light it work very good, but in low light sometimes auto focus dont work well and need to switch to manual focus which is again great. Image stabilize (IS): This works great as canon provide lens level image stabilization. While taking snap if your hand shake then also it will take care of it. But if you expect that it will work against long exposure time then it wont work well.
Image quality The 600D primarily with the kit 18-135mm lens but it also comes in a range of other kit configurations including a more standard 18-55mm. As the sensor and image processor of the 550D and 600D is identical, image quality is exactly the same. What this means to photographers who haven't experienced the 550D is excellent colour rendition and noise control at high ISO levels. Dynamic range is very good, though there can be some highlight clipping in contrasty situations when using automatic exposures. JPEG processing is very good through most ISO levels. ISO 3200 and 6400 (the highest of the native ISO range) produce acceptable levels of noise for reduced or web resolution use. Colour noise at full magnification is quite pronounced though. Video quality Video quality, as with the 550D, is excellent. It's simply the best you can get on any SLR in this particular price bracket. Colour rendition is superb and the video image is smooth. Even the internal microphone seems to produce better audio than on the 550D. The 600D also gets manual audio levels (though still no method to monitor the audio before recording apart from referring to the visual meter). Thanks for Reading this Review........:P
Delivery was delayed (got the camera in around 10 days after ordering) but that is a different story. Coming to the Camera, it is the best DSLR available in this price range. Though a bit expensive than 550D (because it has negligible additional features) but the movable screen available in this model makes it a better choice when compared to 550D. A must buy for every one who loves to play with various features like shutter speed, Aperture Etc.
The option cash on delivery was not available to my location, i prepaid entire sum in advance and ordered Canon EOS 600D 18-55mm lens kit, another lens lit 55mm -250mm and Hoya 58mm Filter kit. I was very much anxious with a little worry too. But true to the Flipkart Ad on Tv the goods are exactly the same as shown in photos and specifications.I highly recommend you too can marry ..oops purchase goods of any high value at Flipkart and be rest reassured the groom ...oops goods will exactly the same as shown on the website.Thank you Flipkart. Now for me too a mega store is there to big shopping!!!!!!
I have been able to get my hands on one since past 3 days, using it along with a 75-300 mm 4-5.6 and a 50mm 1.8 lenses. Camera looks compact for a DSLR. Neatly designed menus and has creative effects like toy camera, grainy black and white, soft focus and miniature effects. The swivel LCD is nice and bright, and highly useful in shooting at difficult angles. Given such a short duration, I wont be able to write comprehensively about this camera but here are some pros and cons I found. Pros: -Compact body, feels like advance superzoom cameras -3.7 frames Is quiet good (though it slows down at high ISOs) -You can zoom into the frame to check sharpness of focus. Button on top right of the back side -Flip screen LCD highly useful - Upto 12800 ISO can be used (visible and distinct noise at 12800ISO, 6400 recommended) -in camera creative effects, though wished there were more. Cons: -exposure value adjustment and bracketing buried deep inside menus -Only 1 cross type autofocus point (more time to focus on moving subjects) though there are total 9 autofocus points. -manual focus must with f 1.8 50mm lens, struggles otherwise -auto white balance tends to favor warmer side, gives orange tint while shooting under incandescent light -ONLY 440 shots per charge Overall a good DSLR for beginners, make sure you get a normal(50mm) lens and a zoom (75-300mm) lenses which cost about additional 21,000 more. If you are not too much into technicalities and want a dslr to start with. Go for it.
I've been using this camera for quite some time and I can assure that this one is far better than any dSLR one can find in this price bracket. Moreover, the image results are damn good, colours are crisp, bright and just what one can expect from a dSLR. This the perfect choice for those who want to upgrade from a bridge camera to a dSLR... Overall... Nice rugged design, excellent images, almost 4 clicks per sec, very quick auto-focus
Canon has managed to hit it spot on yet again with this entry level dslr that perfectly fits the budget of most enthusiasts who want a good entry level SLR. Flipkart's delivery was superb as I got this in just 3 days from placing the order!
d 3200 has a slightly better image quality but 600d has much better video quality and even the MACRO mode. go for 600d because: 1. the macro mode 2. awesome video quality 3. extremely helpfu flipout screen
it is so nice working good camera.i found it in your site very lowest price compare with another stores.this product also looking very good.i found it in your site very lowest price compare with another stores.this product also looking very good
an awesome product from Canon, you cannot tag to be an entry level device, but yes an Intermediate shall be fine enough, crisp photographs, a good CMOS sensor, awesome snapshots, feels a bit heavy after putting it long on the neck, better to opt for an waist holder, n recommended 55-250 mm telephoto lens a few months after the purchase, cause the zoom is'nt what u'd desire for in KIT-1
Bought a new piece of it and found it really awesome and the image quality is outstanding one.This model is better than the other costlier Nikon models and people who are just into photography can go for it.
I wanted to buy this camera for a while now and I got it a month ago. I just love this camera. But if you compare this one with Nikon D5100, Nikon may score better in terms of image quality and price. But 600D scores well in video quality. 18MP in 600D and 16.1MP in D5100 wont make a big difference. The wireless flash option which is in 600D is a handly feature, which is not there in D5100 and external wireless flash transmitter cost too much. I'm a Canon fan so i opted for Canon. So its individuals call to to opt for which one they want.
Canon EOS 600D is a good camera for people who wants to experiment with video along with excellent still photography results. It is light , due to its polycarbonate body , having an excellent tilt and swivel lcd screen which helps greatly in taking photos in odd angles. The high ISO performance is best in class,high iso performance is same as some of the costlier canon dslr like EOS 7D.Burst rate could have been more , but is enough keeping in mind the target user base.Best enthusiast level dslr in the market. One point is , this model makes Canon's EOS 550D rather redundant. With little extra money than 550D you will get better video quality,noise performance and a tilt-swivel screen. GO FOR IT.
A new entry in Canon EOS family and already acknowledged as a winner in its category. Hats off to the excellent image production thanks to the DIGIC4 processor. This camera is a true performer for those who love to experiment , say nature or other blissfull things in this world!!!! :-) I am proud to hold this possession and would recommend anybody looking for a DSLR with superb performance under 50K.. Flipkart at its best is offering the camera under 50K price tag where as Canon India is labeling the device for 50,999 rupees as recommended retail price. CHEERS TO CANNON AND FLIPKART :)
After purchasing from Flipcart user can able to register for canon edge?
i wanna know if lense with it is ef-s18-55mmf/3.5-5.6 is ? there is not any e mail address to contact before placing order.please make me confirmed if lanse is (18-55 is) then i will make order
I got the Camera in 4 days flat and if the courier hadn't messed up a little I would have got it in two. Packing was very good with no chance of damage as mentioned above. What stood out was the excellent customer service both before and after the order (although i communicated only be email), replies were prompt and not the stereo type that u expect with call centers and customer care associates. - Altogether A . rest assured I will be making more purchases at Flipkart. Thanks a lot PS - I don't need to write much about teh camera except that it was a made in Japan model and the attached bag was also of good quality. Altogether a handsome deal.
