Nikon Coolpix L28 Point & Shoot Camera@@@Great Product, best quality for best price. Delivery was quick and even got additional rechargeable battery for free
Hiii all, I have purchased Nikon Coolpix L28 in month of october. First when i received this product, this was not as described on website. Thanks to Flip Kart they returned that. When i received another replaced camera Nikon coolpix L28, its speed is too much slow. I thought it may be due to setting.. but till today, Its speed is too slow. When i take a pic and pose for another then the time in two click is much larger and believe me too harashing, when you are with cam of 20mgpxl but taking too much time. I want to replace but they are not doing for same. I have decided not to buy any product by flip kart coz they only sold bad product.
this is the first product i ordered via mobile via opera browser.. loved the experience.. n the product too..
It was purchased for my dad, easy to use and who gives a 20MP cam for under 5k Bucks, Superb delivery as usual by Flipkart. Just I felt processor is bit slow as you have to wait for 5-6 secs to take next picture.
It take 2-3 seconds to get the focus right and you misses the timing for the perfect moments.Better stay away from this .Useless 20 Mp sensor.better oo any sony or canon or 8 MP Smartphones
It was nice experience to shop with flipkart and get a product in really good price! It was nice experience to shop with flipkart and get a product in really good price! It was nice experience to shop with flipkart and get a product in really good price!
hi i have purchased this Nikon Coolpix L28 Point & Shoot before 7 months. as per my experince i can say it is very nice deal . for low budget u can go for this.
Very very slow. It takes about 3-4 seconds to save the photo making it very inconvenient to take a second snap. Picture qualitiy not that great in low low light. Bottomline : A camera I would NOT recommend. I now use mine as a backup camera
I bought this camera as I wanted one which could use AA batteries. I use rechargeable batteries for this. Good service by Flipkart. Pros : Low price Uses AA batteries. You can always buy batteries if your rechargeable ones run out Passable photos in daylight. reasonable video. Cons Very very slow. It takes about 3-4 seconds to save the photo making it very inconvenient to take a second snap. Picture qualitiy not that great in low low light. Bottomline : A camera I would NOT recommend. I now use mine as a backup camera
It is an oldest edition. Now, Nikon try to clear there stock by gifting an old style watch as a free Gift. Plz guys, don't go for it. It's a boring camera. Picture & Battery quality is not so bad. But, its not for us.
i was surprised to find this product for such a low price... video clarity is just amazing ... thanks to flipkart... but automatic flash is a headache... it destroys the pic!
Slow processing. It takes min 10-15 sec to capture next image. Overall I am not fully satisfied with the camera.
the nikon camera takes a little time for clicking the next photo after clicking one photo...overall a nice product for the price.. with 20.1 MP good clearty of image and video.
nicely packed the camera by flip kart (fill air extreme .inflatable packaging and Sealed Air) it's lightweight an nice looking camera ,flash is very power full it take the photo more brighter shutter speed is very nice. video quality is nice hd ,the strap and case is very good User's manual book and Reference Manual is help to to take every step more details about the modes and buttons . it take time to recoding complete videos
the camera takes a little time for clicking the next pic after clicking one...overall a nice product for the price....
its taking long tym for snapshots and not so good for battery lasting m not satisfied with product.Its even geting strucked in the middle.Think this is a failure for canon product.
The product is not worth buying. Tried with different settings, but all the pictures were shaky and blurred. Also it is taking a huge processing time.
the delivery time was as usual good, well the camera is good for daylight photography & gives some descent pictures. During night time also pictures were good enough with flash. I tried shooting the videos during night time, but the video quality was not that good. Overall the camera is still the best in its range with its CCD Image Sensor.
This camera delivers excellent image quality in daylight as well as in night shots using the flash.It has a host of great features.I would like to particularly mention the Easy Auto Mode feature.Once selected, the camera automatically adjust the best settings required for an image to be taken at that point of time whether it be a macro shot or a night time shot,This feature alone does justice to the Point and Shoot category of Digital Cameras.Last but not the least, this camera has 20 megapixels of resolution for such a low price tag.
Good Camera @ Decent Cost. With decent options! Simply value for Money products. I actually Bought this for My Friend as a Wedding Gift. He is very happy with the Camera and Gift.
Flipkart's service has always been quick and hassle free for me and this one was no different. But speaking about the camera, I dont think the camera is that good. It lags a lot, pics taken are not that clear, and are no way close to what a 22mp camera should be clicking.
Within 5K I got 20 Mega Pixel Camera Nikon Coolpix L28 with Excellent Photo Quality. I will suggest the buyers to buy this camera if their budget is 5K and want to have a Digital Camera with good quality.
I was totally satisfied with the commitment of delivery. Within 2 days the product was delivered. The package too was quite attractive. Rechargeable batteries and charger was of Godrej GP brand which was quite unexpected. No other site had similar offer.
I am using Nikon Coolpix L28 Point & Shoot from August 2013 this has been a wonderful experience to shoot with it, it is a better product in its class and price range, picture quality is very good, and it's body is appealing and good looking.I am happy to use it. Pros:Best value for money, high resolution, good battery backup, clear video and voice recording. Cons: It takes considerable time(5-10 sec) to reload between consecutive shoots.
Just got my Nikon L28 camera delivered today. The seller doesn't have an impressive rating(67%), so I was a little bit hesitate ordering from Flipkart, but from my previous experiences of Flipkart(for the record, I'm a regular buyer of Flipkart), I decided to order from this seller. The product was delivered in 7 days and the packaging was pretty good too. Well done, Flipkart! Now talking about the camera, the camera looks pretty good in terms of design. But the big problem is when you click the photos. Even 20 MP photographs looks similar to my Lumia 520's 5 MP camera on the TFT screen of L28. However, when you see the pics on LED monitor or TV, they're pretty fine. It has a 5x optical zoom & 4x digital zoom. Digital zoom is indeed useless & spoils the photo quality a big time(more than you can expect), so the actual usable zooming is 5x. The thread given with the camera is too small to attach and the camera case doesn't have any belt to wear in the neck! However, these are not big issues. The user interface of camera is good & it's easy to figure out all the features of camera(didn't took more than 15 minutes to me). The good part is that Nikon have provided an additional set of batteries so that you don't have to bother of less charging. The charger looks delicate though. Nikon has provided a special button to record 720p videos(unlike some other cameras, where you have to change the option from photo capturing to video recording). The quality of video recording is average(similar to my phone's camera!). Overall, the camera is good for photo capturing, but seeing pics on TFT screen won't impress you at first. For 5500 bucks, this product is worth give a try.
If you want to take casual nice pix. Its great, the details it captures is very nice. But I think the color production could have been better. The size of the pix are 8MB mostly with 20 MP sittings. It has nice features like all other normal cameras. Though if you are looking for something very professional kind I think there are other options. With the price its a nice camera.
Recently bought this camera from flipkart. The camera does adhere well to the feature of "point and shoot". But the time it takes to process the photo after click is about 5-6 seconds which is bad. So is the case when one tries to delete photo... again it takes about 5-6 secs. When recording the videos the sound quality is not so good. Overall an average product.
Handy, Easy to use & Best in class in this price category. One should use it. Delivery also in time.
This is a good camera if you dont want to shell out too much money and are just looking to buy a camera for personal use. If you are looking for High quality pics then this product is not meant for you. But still having a camera for less than 5K is good as I just wanted it for personal use. Photo quality is decent and they give you rechargeable batteries which is good too.
DEAR SIR / MADAM, I HAVE PURCHASED THIS CAMERA FOR MY DAUGHTER'S CHRISTMAS GIFT. HER COMMENTS IS "FANTASTIC - I AM VERY HAPPY". THANKS AND REGARDS
camera is superb. but u have to compromise some things like it becomes little bit slow as its battery gets discharged . I would recommend this camera because in 5000 Rs u are getting 20 mega pixel. since Its good because u can take a clear image of high speed running fan. Image size with flash is around 8 MB , without flash its around 4.5 to 5 MB. So I think U can imagine the clarity of images. If u can adjust with AA battery then no problem. I would like to share one thing very interesting that battery which is given with this camera is easily fitting here but if u purchase any AA battery from market and try to fit here then it might not be fit here, for that u have to rub the bottom/top most part of the battery to make it flat. Actually u know there is a problem with ordinary AA battery because it needs fully flat surface of battery neither its spring stucks there . so for that rub the battery upper part a bit to make it flat then it wont stuck. Overall its nice product u can take around 150 to 200 images by charging the battery once.
not a good product to buy....very slow in every aspect...taking time to shoot another photo and taking to time to view the picture. i think very low internal memory. not recommeded at all......
I bought this camera (silver coloured) from flipkart. good service. Great picture quality .It is very cheap with 20mp. Good performance smart looking
I had used this camera for a month now. My assesment +ve points 1) Easy to handle 2) 20 mega pixel 3) Very affordable 4) Good camera for Novice -ve points 1) L28 is not build for speed. This is especially a draw back if you are taking photographs of moving objects. The time taken for the camera to processes the image and save them to memory takes around 20 secs. 2) Quality of close up shots are poor. 3) Heavy Noise (Grainy) with ISO 200 and above
the biggest disadvantage is that the camera takes nearly 10-15 seconds to store the image taken, only after which we can click the next photo..its too much of a time to wait b4 u go to the next shot..the display screen quality of the camera is very poor that makes that the pics resolution is bad. but actually if u transfer the images to the computer it looks good. but not many would appreciate it. However, flipkart package & delivery were satisfactory.
i bought this product after reading many reviews but was shocked to see the actual product in hand. The body is made up of very cheap material compared to Fujifilm cameras, the 20 mp actually doesnt look like its 20 mp
Excellent in one word..... in this price..... i buy this in 4990 from flipkart :) thankyou flipkart......... awesome packing & delivery :)
the camera was really awesome, the camera comes with a watch will was also great.the features were good. the delivery was fast and quick. the payment was safe, secure and reliable.
I bought this point and shoot for my daughter's 12th birthday as she would keep loading my mobile phone and camera with her pictures. My daughter is very happy with this. For a point and shoot the quality of pictures is excellent! It is small and sleek and fits easily into her small purse as well. About the service, I got this product within 3 days even before the expected date of arrival. It was gift wrapped (of course I asked for it) and packed with bubble wrapped for protection. I was also lucky to get a watch absolutely free along with this. All in all an excellent product - an excellent service..
Got this Camera. After using it for 2 days here is my feedback. Pros: 1. It's Nikon Camera. 2. 20 MP is cool. 3. 5 X Optical Zoom. 4. Small and Sweet design. 5. Decent low light picture. But don't expect miracle from an 5K camera. 6. You can use Normal AA battery. So even if you are out of charge, just buy any AA battery and use it. 7. Free 2100 mah * 2 battery, 4 GB Memory card, Pouch and Timex Watch. Here are the cons: 1. I find this phone little bit slow. Overall this is a great buy.
Tooo slow when taking photos. And thee image quality is not at all good. Need to train others if they are using this camera to "How to use it". Pathetic performance and bad image quality. Don't go for this product.
Can’t imagine that I got such good service by purchasing online. I want to thank Star CJ for making online shopping so ease! Full marks to them…
I ordered this on 5th December and got it on 10th nicely packed thanks to Flipkart. This camera is incredible it is beyond my expectations. I thought as it is of a low price 4999 it would be too slow but it's not. It is better than my 16 MP camera with 8x zoom of price 10599. Picture quality is amazing as it is a 20 MP camera. The freebie Timex watch is also nice. If you are thinking of buying a camera under 8000 go for this one.
Really i wonder with flipkart delivery. Just 3 days to take delivery. awesome camera, really wonder offer, i got a watch with this camera superb
Good camera , affordable , simple , switch on and use value for money capture your moments. Flipkart amazing ..services... they should add more credit cards for offers and benefits .
Ordered the product on 29th Nov ....got on the 30th.....need i say anymore on the express blazing fast-delivery...?? camera is just awesome at this steal-deal price....720p HD recording.... packaging :5/5 Quality: 5/5 Satisfaction :10/10 Fabulous Images.... overall a product....worth the money....
I have already purchased mobile from you. I like to purchase this camera, but, all the freebies offered by you are available with me. I have three Eveready chargers and eight Eveready batteries. I have two watches. I already have memory cards. So, just offer the main product alone with pouch with the least possible price for me. I do not like to pay for the freebies also unnecessarily. Please consider this and send me the offer price for the camera + pouch alone, if possible. Thanks.
First thanks to flipkart . i get the delivey on next day of booking.. camera is great i used in diwali and takes lot of pics .. it takes great pictures . battery is also good.. resolution is great if u want to buy a good camera in average price.. GO FOR IT.... ONCE AGAIN THANKS TO FLIPKART......
This is one of the best product which truely fits its worth. A very cool deal in this range,be it the matter of performance,quality,look & life it stands ahed of all. GO FOR IT!!!!! & capture all your precious life moments very smartly.
Good performance of this camera Nikon trusted brand with flipkart best delivery
It feels very cheep & the plastic body is breaking easily.The Auto focus sucks.The zoom quality is very bad & there is not much control on your photos espessialy There is no ISO control. Dont buy this.. Cannon power shot 16mp camera is much better.
The camera is awesome and delivery as expected came 1 day after order according to me best camera in this range.
Thanks Flipcart and the dealer to make this festival A W E S O M E .. the Nikon Coolpix L28 is a awesome camera and the package includes .. # Cover # 4 GB Card # A charger with to chargeable battery # and the less to tie the camera with hand . Thanks !
This is a useless camera for me. IT is slow in processing the picture, my Nokia E71 will process faster than this. Purchase it as my earlier Kodak Camera (Free with Printer) was broken. I still miss that camera The offer and goodies were good but thing twice before purchasing this camera, as during your good moments you might get frustrated as Flash will not work, will be very slow.
Excellent camera with 20 MP camera, Flipkart Packing is excellent and its delivered before time. With this Pack i received Timex watch freely. i received the package with warranty card, memory card, rechargeable battery and 2AA size battery, data cable travel charger pouch and camera everything. Excellent Product at excellent price
it had been a WOW for me with its 20.1 mega pixels n its crystal clear pictures. but i rate it 4 bcoz i think more features would make it WOW WOW WOW....it was a gud buy for me....
Coolpix L28 is best for range 4-5K. Awesome clarity. HD video. More image modes. battery last for more time. it really deserves it.
very user friendly, being a novice to cameras n photography, I feel this does serve the purpose of taking neat pictures without any hassles.
The best and Cheap Camera Ever Must have one. I got this Product withing 2days i am very happy about this. Little worry is memory card writing speed is little Slow it will take 5sec to come back to camera screen but Resolution is Very Very Good it will cover of 8 to 9MB of each Image.
I purchased this camera seeing the rating and also the features. Believe this is the worst working camera i have ever seen in my life. Please do not buy for gods sake.
I placed an order on 15th Oct at night time. I received on 17th Oct in the morning. Flipkart deliver their product within time & with good packing. To my surprise, I have got Timex watch free as well :) I haven't use this digicam as of now but I hope it will fulfill my expectation of taking good quality pics :) I could have order this product today, price is slashed by Rs.350/- now in just 2 days :( Still Good Service by Flipkart. Keep continuing the good work.
This was my 1st time shopping through flipkart and it was mind blowing. The cam is dam good with awesome clarity and very easy yo use,the delivery of the flipkart and service was too good, i got the product delivered next day. every thing was just perfect. the pack was sealed and all the things proper inside it. it has been a great experience to shop through Flipkart
It is best camera. working good. color nice and attractive. good picture clarity. low shutter lag. simply super
The product is superb if you are planning to buy in low budget. It has amazing feature for 20.1 MP camera and 5x zoom at low cost,with decent color body.They have free bees which is great on there part. Though it had been a mixed experience in buying this product .They had offer for buying Nikon Camera with scan disk pendrive .As soon as i was about to buy,offer was closed a minute ago. So just check once while doing checkout . Delivery was very quick,but they had missed one of the free bee items in the shipment.But later on they handled it nicely. I would in general appreciate this product and their delivery.
I had ordered Nikon Coolpix L28 (Black) on Sunday 22 Sep 2013 and by Saturday afternoon 05 Oct 2013 it was delivered. Awesome delivery service by Flipkart and WS retail team. Regarding the products was delighted to get freebies like 4 GB memory card, Camera Pouch, strap, Extra pair of batteries (rechargeable) and a cool Timex wrist watch. The camera has 20 MP CCD sensor and 5X optical Zoom. I clicked few Pics and Picture quality and color reproduction was good. However the picture looks grainy on camera Screen. It was easy to transfer the Pics from camera to my Desktop. I tried Zoom feature at low light and was delighted with its quality of snap taken. Also did HD recording and it captured excelled video recording with zoom facility. The photo file size is in around 8.5 MB and about 1 minute video takes 200 MB size. Of the 11 Pics that I clicked 6 turned out super sharp, 2 good quality , 1 average and 2 were blur and hence not as expected. These shots were taken in Auto mode. Overall a good point and shoot for day to day use.
Photos are comparable as 20MP camera...... Photos in low light are bad....... Seeing the photos with the comparable with my 12 MP Mobile Camera..... Feels like waste my money........
Guys just dont miss this camera its a great camera at a cheaper price........and so in my openion flipkart is the best online shopping store .i orderedthis camera on 4oct at evening and i got delivery in the next day morning only i.e 5th oct at morning..........buy it itz superb.......
If u can spend more than 5000 then plz dont buy this product just because its cheap Overall the camera is nice by looking at its price its just value for money if can spend more than this surely consider canon cameras...
Just got this camera from flipkart..took some pictures,recorded some clips in 720p Hd quality..overall picture quality is awesome if you have a little bit knowledge of photography you can take Gr8 pics from this..when i saw the reviews before purchasing this i was bit confused about this camera as most of the user told that it takes 10-15 sec to get ready for next shoot but when i took pics i ws shocked to ess that it just takes 3-4 sec for the next shot..so dont go for fake reviews, and if you want camera in 5K just purchase this without a little bit thinking..i am sure it will not disappoint you.
It has nice features.some xtra ordinary features like,20 mega pixel is also included.Nice model for beginners.
Awesome Picture Quality, Very good Flash , Light Weight, Quick Image Processing, Shortcut Key for Video Recording, Optical Zoom is nice. Comes with Free 4GB SD card, Charger and Battery, Pouch. Its Worth buying and I am satisfied with this product.

Well bought this camera two weeks ago at 5100 only and i am satisfied with this.zoom quality is not that much good but in this price i got sufficient features.Anyone can buy this cam without doubt when budget under 6k.
This is a camera with amazing quality and clarity. The reduced price makes it even sweeter. Serves your purpose and is a great buy. I got a 4gb and 8gb memory card along with the pouch absolutely free of cost which makes this camera a must buy.
I compltly satisfied with these product and it is with n number of features and its clarity and zoom was awesome..... i completly satisfied with this product and zooming capacity was good and it has number of features and with HD recording facility and i don't expected such a camera in my budget..
I ordered this camera for my Sister-in-law in India and when I compared the prices online I got a very good deal from Flipkart. My sis-in-law is ecstatic getting it for Rakhi gift. Amazingly super fast delivery with very good packaging from Flipkart. Camera Resolution is amazing. Picture quality and image stabilizing functions are the best. I would recommend this to others as well. 5,000 Rupees for 20.1 MP Digital camera is worth the Money.
light weight, build with quality material & attractive colors, 20 mega pixel quality is same as the quality which will you get in a cell phone with 12mp, use only alkaline batteries for better battery life. for professional go to nikon SLR camera.
got this cam somedayz ago from flipkart.com.. But flipkart took some time to deliver this product..received it in 7 dayz.. Wen it comes to camera..itz really gud..i would say just awesome... itz worth my money Plz go for it.. !!!!
packing was good, delivery was best,but like this products purchase plz provide special gifts to customers ..if some gifts provide rigth happy. The performance of cam was good but batteries was not well company .
I am happy to purchased Nikon Coolpix L28 from Flipkat. First of all, I will say Flipkart packing and service is admirable. Nikon Coolpix L28 clicked image look actual and it performs very well even in dim light. It is light in weight and fascinating look. It is one of the best family camera at reasonable price. Therefore, I will give 5/5. Thank You, SANJAY SINGH LUCKNOW
It is really a good product, im fully satisfy with this camera. But im unable to shoot a video more than a minute. this is only a drawback... It is really a good product, im fully satisfy with this camera. But im unable to shoot a video more than a minute. this is only a drawback...
I just want to say, even my ace S5830i's 5MP cam is much-2-3 better than L-28's 20MP. Buying this cam is just waste of money, if you have extra money, then go for it. ;) I give it 1/10
Thanks to flipkart for providing my order in time with a good packaging. Coming to the product, its really a good and full featured camera having sharp picture clarity at the price range of 6k.. I took many snaps in low light and the response was awesome... zooming of the camera z also better even at maximum zoom i.e 5x without blurring the picture Just worried about the warranty period becaz nothing is mentioned on warranty card otherwise no issues...go for it
This camera is ok type of camera.But flipkart service is great. I got this camera within a week in a good condition.I got extra 2 rechargeable batteries with this kit and it has 2 year warranty. This product is made in china. So, I am not sure about it's durability.
FlipKart delivery and offer was really fantastic as usual. Apart from the items mentioned here, the box had the USB cable for transferring photos to Computer/ TV/ printer and 2 panasonic Nokia MH batteries. @filpkart: pls include here. All pros mentioned in the review comments turned out to be true in my case also. So, I don't want to mention the pros mentioned already. The cons mentioned were not true in my case. - Both Optical and Digital zoom carried good quality picture. - The time gap between successive photo shots is not too much. It is pretty cool. I am trying to say that I felt this camera is pretty fast though I haven't compared it against others. - The Battery charger is working fine for me. No issues in that. - One thing I would like to says is that, the camera carries many options and you have to study the features well to take a snap with the right mode and with proper exposure and flash. - Some said the flash cannot be turned on and only auto flash is there, but if you choose the 'auto mode' instead of 'Easy auto mode' you have 5 options to control the flash. So, study the camera well and you will be able to take amazing pictures for sure. Again I say, this is not in comparison with any other cameras.This is my first digital camera and I have more interest in taking good quality pictures and this didn't disappoint me. I would recommend this..... One thing that is disturbing me is that the software CD offered by Nikon is having some trial softwares and not full versions, but dont worry, you will be able to transfer the photos and videos without any issues with the normal transfer process.
Image Quality is really bogus. flip kart delivery was good take 2-3 days to deliver this product. Picture taken time to shoot ,It take about 15 second to get ready to take next snap. package includes all items flipkart mentioned. Slower processing speed....takes upto 8-9 secs to finish recording a picture on 20mp mode.
this is my first review ever in FLIPKART !!! but NIKON forced me to review this product Wat a nice product from NIKON...!!!!!! I can't tell anything about this cam... This is the level of goodness ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 20.1 Megapixels from just 5108/- OH MY GOD !!!!! WAT A CAM... awesome,,,brilliant,,,and all word from dictionary which meaning is about Good..
Satisfied but they gave some ordinary envie brand Charger (The charger is not working) and battery. The customer care response was frustrating. Anyway I paid just 3887 so I am happy. Ok
At 5k you will get the best pictures this 20.1 MP camera made me worth it buying..awesome quality pics and motion sensor is awesome and is best for night shoot my rating goes 4.5/5.You can buy it without any hesitation.
Thank you flipkart for your consistent and great service. It was like a jackpot! a real value-for-money deal. and you have delivered it exactly after 3 working days... My heartiest appreciation for the scheduled delivery, compact packaging and above all, quality of service. The cam is great too... :)
Edited on 11-7-2013: Got the camera delivered by flipkart.........I think its my lucky visit to flipkart .For a moment, I can't believe my eyes.I know the price of the camera on flipkart as Rs.5103, but the price suddenly dropped to Rs.3887.Whoa...am I dreaming???It's a 20 mp camera!!!!! Immediately after I had just placed the order, the price again bounced back to Rs.5103.YES I AM THE LUCKIEST PERSON ON THAT DAY!!!!!!! Just went ahead and placed the order......It has got all the items listed by flipkart. Pros: 1.Fastest shutter spped, you can even click a picture of a running fan very much clear. 2.Great looks......just looks very much premium in red colour. 3.The flash performs just perfect. 4.The battery consumption is very low...can click upto 200-250 pics per charge with the supplied batteries. 5.All AA size batteries....you can have the advantage of buying AA size ordinary batteries when your rechargable batteries worn out. 6.Big 3-inch screen...when I first showed the camera to my mom, she thought it was a touchscreen.....LOL:-) Cons: 1.The shots were not upto the 20mp mark even in the outdoors.My canvas 2 clicks better pics than this camera. 2.The pics look crisp in the camera screen,but looks just average when viewed on the computer.The 5X optical zoom is also not upto the mark. 3.Slower processing speed....takes upto 8-9 secs to finish recording a picture on 20mp mode. 4.Videos are damn bad...cannot tolerate the quality....but the thing is that you can zoom while shooting a video.This feature is really missing even in cams upto 7000bucks. Anyway....I'll rate it 3/5.I will recommend buying a 16mp shooter from canon instead of nikon.
my first experience of shopping at flipkart is very good, i bought nikon camera L28 , i like it a lot, it has a Smart Portrait mode that will enable a Smile Timer which will take a picture automatically as soon as it detects a smile in the frame - even if you don't press the button. Accompanying that is a Blink detection system and Skin softening software to reduce blemishes.
quality...good, packing...as safe as can, lowest price...and every thing is there in box.. but little bit late in delivery... AT LAST IF ANY ONE THINKING TO BUY IN LOW BUDGET THEN GO FOR IT..TODAY I GOT IT AND EVERY THING IS GOING SMOOTHLY...
I ordered this on 16-06-2013.It taken one day time to transit from Bangalore to Hyderabad through FEDEX courier, I have waited 3 days but fedex not delivered, finally i went to fedex couriers and collected the pack, worst service. Nikon L28 taking 10 to 20 seconds time after taken the shot. Processing is very very slow. Picture quality is average. Don't buy this product.
Now this time thanks to Flipkart service got camera with in 24 hours. But price is higher than other websites. + ve points .. 1, Very Nice quality 20 mp , 5152*3864 2. Motion sensor, You can take snap of rotating fan without any blurriness. 3. It start just in 1 sec. 4. Eye-fi technology 5 . it use AA battery. -ve Point : It take about 15 second to get ready to take next snap
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WORD, GOOD PACKING, CONTAINED ALL ITEMS IN PERFECT CONDITION, GOOD CAMERA. I GOT IT IN A WEEK. A 20.1 MEGA PIXEL CAMEL CAMERA IN SUCH A LOW PRICE , UNBELEIVABLE
I am purchase this camera from croma electronics . Not from flipkart because flipkart does not provide delivery service to my location. the camera is very nice and camera picture quality is superb. I suggest you to buy this camera.
I bought it a few days ago from flipkart and trust me it is really a good buying.20 megapixel and that too within 6000k is something that is indeed praiseworthy for Nikon as the other rivals failed to offer such,maximum of which may be of 16 megapixel.I have always been a fan of Nikon from the beginning and going by the performance till now i am truly satisfied.Crystal clear picture quality with 5x zoom.Gives True HD pictures when you connect it via data cable to laptop.You need not have to install anything.Just plug in the cable via a usb port to the camera and that's it.May be the use of AA pencil batteries may sound a little bit old-fashioned,but it is indeed suitable as you don't have to recharge it now and then.Just carry it as a back up and when the other batteries are down,you have the options to use them.And to say about after maintenance,you all know Nikon excels in it's service.They have a dedicated after maintenance service.And to say about Flipkart's delivery,it was good.Good packaging and on time delivery within 2-3 days.So guys,go for it without giving a second thought as it would be a worth buying.
Please don't buy this product this is totaly wastage of money i had buy this product when i click some shot and check pics in my laptop i just shocked my samsung 8 mp cam has far better images then this 20mp cam so just please say to yes sony or samsung atleast no to this cam otherwise you will lose your money as i lose my money now i am wondering how i can get my money back
This camera is the best base camera for its price. It has some image stabilization problem, but still manageable. It has got a good battery life and comes with rechargable battery, charger, pouch and memory card. I bought it from Flipkart and the service is excellent.
don't buy its not good to buy in-comparison to that if you buy sony pns that tis faar better then this.. this camera has got poor picture clarity. so if you are intrsted in camera go for samsung or Sony... nothing like just now i have purchased sony point and shoot its owsome camera... my final words dont buy this nikon L28
For this price range this is an pretty awesome camera. The video comes in 720hd, the video would have been of better quality if provided with 1080hd. The photo quality is superb. The optical and digital zoom is very good.
photos quality are good and realizable. I did a lot market servey and found this is best camera in this range with this much good quality... go for it guys... Good delivery from flip kart..it took only 3 days to deliver
Hi, The product seems promising but NOT the service from flipkart. I ordered this camera on 14th Mar and I was told that I would get it in 2-3 days. I recieved a PHILIPS EPILATOR !!!!!! to my surprise. The bill which was in the corrier box was addressing correctly + the amount and product name. But the product in the box IS different. When Talked to customer care, they told me that they will revert with what I have ordered by 21st Mar. Package - Poor. Worst. Could peep from the corners of the box. HAve pics taken the time Its been handed over to me. If required can pass on. lemme know. Really disappointed with Flipkart as I was NOT expecting this from it. Would like to look forward for my product soon. Thank you. Vishala Bengaluru
