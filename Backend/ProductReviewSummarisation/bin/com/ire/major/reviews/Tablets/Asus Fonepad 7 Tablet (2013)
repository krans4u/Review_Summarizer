Asus Fonepad 7 Tablet (2013)@@@Its a great tablet with an excellent battery life. However the only drawback would be that they should have sold it with headphones. Display and camera both are excellent. You would not be comfortable using it as a phone though. I use it as a spare phone. Also do order its cover alongwith. I made by not doing so. It spoild the tab screen..
A decent tab. The display is awesome. The tab gets stuck some time but its recommended over the google nexus if u want a tab with sim to access the web directly.
Everything is good about this fonepad 7 tab.. Intel processor is really smooth butter. ONLY genuine issue that Asus can solve is the resolution / brightness.. that's very dull.
this tab is very good comparing to its competitors.its display is very good.its battery backup is good.back camera resolution is very good.it is running smoothly without any hanging.the internal memory is low.but you can manage this with agood quality micro sd card.i am living in a small out reach town of tamil nadu but flipkart delivered this product in three days.price is also cheap comparing to others.packing of the product is very good [WS RETAIL]
this is my first Tablet. Very gud Video and Sound clarity . battery backup also good. havent tried with sim option yet. overall its is really nice.
very good phone, update the firm ware and kernel.it works good.Go for thsi phone if you need calling also .good service from flipkart.very excellent
I Bought this product to use it as my tab and primary phone. even though it has a good screen and interface to be used as tab, it is worst phone i have used till date, frequent call drops, every 10 to 15 minutes call gets disconnected. no mater how many times you reset the device or which ever network sim you use, this problem never gets solved. some times you just want to throw this phone.
I bought Nexus 7(2013) previously and this model is comparable to that. This is very nice tablet with in the budget.
After buying nexus 7 2013 LTE version..I bought this for my family..seems to be same hardware and software..But it not full HD..
I bought the product from some other online store during Diwali offer. After only 5 months it started having battery problems. The tablet will not charge when connected to the adapter and a Question mark will appear on screen. After searching online , I found that this is a know issue in this tablet. To fix it i took it to service Center and got it fixed in one day(Charged me 500 bucks). The issue started again after one week. The issue is related to battery not being charged if the power remaining is less than 10 %. Will return it again to service center for a permanent fix. God know how much they are gonna charge me now.
Oh! what a product yaar, at this price, till now, at my 15 years of experience (using different kind of communicators), not used such a excellent product in its range. It is great challenge for Apple, Sony, Samsung ect, You all brands reduce your price otherwise would be invisible down the line 12 to 16 months. Great knock, whoever is seeking for a tab or phone or like to gift your spouse or child (for education purpose) go for it. They will definitely appreciate. One more thing, this product is not available here in bangalore, and we know the fact that sample stuff always would be a perfect stuff to get the attention of users. So, this is good time to buy. For kind of your information, Increase in demand increase the production and this lead to increase in price if not price somewhat compromise with the quality of product. keep this fact in mind and buy it. At the end, i would like to add that it has all the required business features.
Pls provide me a offer which u show up to yesterday and also i like a product thatsy Iam from trivandrum Regards Anoop
Pro: - Good Camera - Good for gaming - Fast processor - Good display Con: - Feels a little heavy - Average speaker sound quality
This tablet is the most awesome tablet I ever seen. The camera, speakers, touch... Wow !!! The design is very sleek and amazing. Need of accessories.. Like cover, earphones.
Friends, whenever my friends purchased, laptop , phone or any other electronic device the major played by luck all the time..whatever may be the manufacturer if it works its fine even if the manufacturer is worse and if it gives you problems whoever may be the manufacturer say samsung or asus etc you always face a nightmare. but if the problem comes in first month itself flipkart is always there to replace..
It's a nice product in this price range. Display, speed and battery are good. only problem is with sound , it's a bit low.
The service asus gave to user is very poor. you must check before buy for yourself. 3 other people have same review here.
Just awesome in everything but there is no exact flip covers for Asus. Otherwise it good choice. :-)
If you looking for Phone and Tab. This is the best product for you. Great Display, Great work n less economy rate... I like it very much.
I REALLY APPRECIATE ITS QUALITY AND SPECIFICATION AND ONE MORE INTEL ATOM PROCESSOR, 5 MP CAMERA AND HD RECORDING
Tab has overall good.. I am using it by one month. Flipkart is giving you great service at all.. for 15000 its a fantastic tab.. overall specification is good.. It's 5mp camera is having good.. Don't laminate over camera lenses.. front camera is also good.. It has an Intel dual core processor.. so MXplayer was supporting for this.. No problem. Default video player can run all types of video format like H.264 MKV, FLV & MP4 & all major Full HD videos. Bluetooth is not working properly for all other devices.. only some devices can connect for it.. so it's the major disadvantages of this tab.. Browsing is very fast.. SIM supports 2G & 3G network also.. Reliance external dongle will not support.. for this tab box accessory is not sufficient.. because it didn't include ear phone or head phone, OTG cable, pouch or case cover & screen guard. you have to buy these all externally.. This tab has a great look.. processor is good. only 3.75GB internal memory that you can use. micro SIM slot.. good for gaming experience.. sound is good.. Overall it's a good tab.. So maximum 4 ratings tab in my experience..
One of my friend bought few month back and facing problem with motherboard. Customer support and the management are pathetic. Feeling sorry for him :( Not expected from a big company like Asus.
A friend of mine bought this tablet in January. I asked him about the review of this product. He said "If the product works fine, it's a good purchase but if it fails, you'll be tortured by ASUS service centre in getting it back to normal state ". The basic problem was that the motherboard had going bad completely within two months of purchase. When asked for repairing at service centre, they quoted the price much higher(Rs 18k) than the cost of the product(Rs 15k). It was surprising to understand how a motherboard can cost higher than the product. I would recommend you to not buy this product as I did not buy it too after this suggestion. Also, Flipkart deleted review of one of the reviewer and my friend Gaurav. He was sent an email by flipkart to remove his review and when he did not remove it, flipkart deleted the deview. As his review was against ASUS and its product which might be decreasing the sales, they prefer to keep user preference and customer satisfaction below their sales. Never expected this from flipkart.
I purchased it via Croma retail and within 4 weeks phone was dead. I travelled to their service centre (with is around 40 km away) and it is mother board problem and they promised me to replace it but despite repeated follow up, I am still waiting for the device and they stopped even responding. DON'T EVER BUY ANY ASUS PRODUCT (Google for Batter issue and you will get lot of posting online)
I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I think this will be more accurate and unbiased. PRO's +IPS HD Screen - Images and Videos look great from any angle. +Processor - Intel Clover Trail+ gets you good performance and Efficiency. +Camera - 5MP rear with decent photos and FHD Video, Good wide angle front camera with HD resolution. +Memory - Comes with 4gb usable memory but expandable up to 64gb with external SD card.(Class 10 16GB external SD will cost you just 850 RS) +Call Facility + 3G - Now this puts the tablets above the rest. I can use it as a phone and I can access internet anywhere with the help of 3G/2G. +Music & Video - The music quality is really good(through Earphones) & FHD videos play flawlessly. +Android - Updated to 4.3 Jelly Bean. Smooth and Fast. +Battery - Gets you through a day easily. +Charger - Comes with a 1.35A charger and gets you a quick charging for such a huge battery. CON's +Glossy Screen - The screen is very glossy and feels uncomfortable for eyes in bright outdoors. The screen also suffers from lack of optimum brightness. The touch sensitivity is also not upto the mark. +Call UI - The User Interface for calling is a bit buggy. Attending calls is troublesome most of the times. Bluetooth call connectivity is poor, takes 3-4 sec to connect to the call after pressing the call button. +GPS & Compass - 8M accuracy even with GLONASS in open space !!!. My Xperia S locks on with 3M accuracy even inside my office. Compass is not so acurate either. +External Speakers - Comes with a Dual Speaker and yet sounds less than my Xperia S Mono Speaker. Very badly disappointed. +Build Quality - Not great at all. Doesn't feel sturdy. +Accessory - No Earphones. Overall its a gret value for money Tab and good enough for designer like me. Please don't forget to charge your Tab for 8 hours before first use(Read user Manual).
Got it a week back.. flawless performance be it touch, camera, response time etc.. it is worth every penny you pay.. and Flipkart delivery is awesome got it 3 days before expected delivery. Although packaging is what vendor needs to be worked on.
I have bought this tab, this is decent TAB in this range, better than SAMSUNG TAB 3 people must not except all TABs with IPAD, because I PAD is differance from all, for this price ASUS is very very good,
What a features, good battery backup, 1.6GHz processor, high quality wifi connectivity, And good space 8 GB, No problem in 3G and 2G connectivity, m happy with this tablet and calling experience. After almost 3 weeks no problem at all, if you are going to buy a mobile phone of more than 5 inch then i do say by this one, if will help you make more faster. Easy to carry, i do say in this rang not second thought just but this phone. i give this fonepad rating 4.9/5.
Just bought the asus fonepad 7 a week ago. Awesome device at a great price. No complaints. Surprisingly the tablet nicely fits into my pocket. Great job asus.
I have purchased this from flipkart for my friend from another account. This is a very great tablet and the 1.6GHZ intel dual core processor is very powerful. As Asus is the same manufacturer of Nexus 7, this tablet has the same form factor of Nexus7. One thing worth noticing is internal memory. I purchased 8 Gb version and only 4 Gb is user accessible. We can expand upto 64 gb microsd card. Still for installing applications internal memory is needed. So go for 16gb version. PROS: Beautiful IPS screen, viewing angle is good. Powerful processor. Expandable storage. and a lot more. Cons: Not much Still I would try to write 2. External speaker is not that great. I feel so. But in headset its wonderful. Glossy back feel slippery. Need to use a case.
