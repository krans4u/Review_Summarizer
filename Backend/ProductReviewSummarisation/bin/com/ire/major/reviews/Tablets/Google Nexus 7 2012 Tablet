Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet@@@don't think we have a better tablet in < 11 K price range. 4.3 upgrade is available. smooth experience, better than samsung tablet which costs greater than 14K .. -ve (no back camera .. not sure why we need a back camera if we have a smartphone.)
Zahur ahmed, where did you buy it from? Try contacting the place where you bought it from at the same time search for service centers. It will help you solve the problem faster.
The performance is good. Sound quality and display are great for the price. The software gets updated as and when there is 1 available. I could not vedio chat using hangouts so far. Need to check on this. Battery standby is good, but full charge doesn't stand even 10 hrs of constant use. to conserve battry you may switch off some of the services like auto rotate or wifi depending on your requirement. This increases the batery life considerably. I used the Maps app to guide me driving to new places. there is no need to talk of flipkart its just excellent.
The tablet is good for reading books and playing HD games,mind you,by HD I mean games like Injustice,NFS Hot Pursuit,Batman and the like.Video playback quality is superb and reminds you of Apple's Retina display. But only wifi and not even a 3g dongle support is why I give this great tablet a four star rating.
After i brought this, within 2 months the tab is not getting charging. No i am searching for the service provider where this can be fixed. I have no idea if my tab will be replace or they will do something.
It was a steal at these price levels. A Great branded Tab at an honest price. It does what it's supposed to.
I liked the Nexus 7 very much after I had a chance to experience it at a shop and so decided to purchase it. The looks are premium and the experience whether applications like games or even internet surfing via browser is excellent. Even movies are a joy to watch on it. Completely worth the money. But a 32 GB tablet like the I bought is really worth getting over the 16GB version.
I am very much willing to buy nexus 7 but I have some doubts in my mind.I would really appreciate if a user can answer my questions. 1. Does it come with screen gaurd and earphones? 2. can I use otg on it without rooting? 3. does kitkat work without any lag or hiccups? 4. can i transfer files from my pc to n7? 5. how is the after sales support? 6. i found somewhere that the screen is washed out,want to know more about it? thanks in advance
This truly is the best tablet available in the Indian market. Forget those over-priced or below-standard tabs. This is just right. Believe me, there is nothing in the Play Store which you cant use on this device. Better not go for the 2013 edition and stick to this 2012 one. You wont repent.
This is my first tab and the review is after using it almost for a month. Firstly, though it's a 2012 model, it is way ahead of the competitors in terms of performance for the given price range...The processor is fast and the RAM is sufficient for multitasking and games. Here are 7 features of the Nexus 7 which I like the most: 1. Ample space: ~26gb (you can store anything and everything-movies, songs, games, apps......) 2. Screen: The screen quality and resolution is good for watching movies 3. Processor: NVidia Tegra Quad Core processor is capable to run high end games smoothly (Real Racing, Asphalt 8...) 4. Build quality and looks are good 5. Google: It will ensure that your is tab is always up-to-date. 6. Battery: It is just Ok but sufficient for day-to-day activities (surfing, movies, games...) 7. Touch response is buttery smooth - no lag whatsoever. I would be more delighted if- - There was a rear camera - There was screen guard/earphone in the box - Flipkart had reduced the price when I bought it ! (I got it for 11.5k, then is was available for 11k) Overall satisfied with the product and flipkart service :)
Its not impressive as thought. No Camera, no port. Only good for games and music. Display is good.I recommend others to analysis the usage of product before buying it.
guys this is awsume tablet in this price range and razing sharp display.i m hardcore gamer n believe me guyz this tablet is made for hardcore gamers.it consist of teagra 3 .samsung n other available tablets are nothing in front of nexus 7.
Got this for 11k! Iv'e been using it for 2 months now and haven't had a problem with it! Games such as fifa 14 , and real racing , gt racing are amazing on this! Becomes slightly hot after long usage. It connects to my dslr pretty easily! Also managed to install whatsapp on it. IT DOESN'T FEEL OUTDATED AT ALL!!
Firstly - Awesome service by FLIPKART! I got the product within 24 hours of ordering. Fantastic packaging too. Reason for buying another tablet: I wanted to buy a tablet for my 2 yr old daughter - YES 2 yrs old... She WANTS TO PLAY with my iPad, my Lumia phone and my wife's iPhone. Though she handles the gadgets very carefully without dropping, she doesnt exactly know what she is playing with so sometimes some contacts would get dialled, or some info gets deleted. Why Nexus 7 2012: We thought of buying a 4k-5k tablet and quickly realized that it is way below in quality and performance - especially display. the closest was the Lenovo for 5k and the iBall 9inch tablet for 7k. but we did some quick comparisons and found out that this is actually a Superb tablet for 11k and also beats the iPad mini (without retina) in many ways. Hence we decided to buy this and use this for our daughter to play games and - we can also use this for our own home purpose while we can keep our other expensive gadgets away from the kid and use it strictly for work. Pros: 1. 32GB is Killer! get all the games / apps u want 2. quad pro processor is faster than anything in competition 3. fantastic display 4. thin and light Cons: 1. No Back Camera, only front for video chat etc 2. Only 1 GB ram - but thats ok as the processor is pretty fast itself 3. No 3G facility 4. No video output facility so u cant hook it up to a TV etc
If you're looking for a 7-inch tablet, we'll put it like this: there is no better alternative on the market. It's not quite as good as the new iPad mini, but if you don't fancy iOS this is the tablet you want
If you have no budget to buy an ipad then google nexus is the next best choice to buy. Its much user friendly in comparison to ipad. You can copy any data from your external hard disc with much ease. Most of the google apps are free for download as well. Iam sure you will not repent for the choice made
This tablet is amazing at this price range...... Pros :- Stock Android UI which is easy to use .. NVIDIA Processor..... it works superbb for gaming... NO lags in FULL HD movies.... Itz also having GOOGLE NOW.... by which we can work without touching fingers. 10 point multi touch... Games like FRUIT NINJA, AE Slash etc... can we played easily.. Touch is amazing... it works very well and the keyboard is also optimized my ASUS. Now its very very easy to typpe.... (even compared to iOS 7.1.1) THIS IS THE BESTESTEST among all these... insects (Galaxy tab 3, Acer etc..) AND I am sure..... you wouldn't try find more dummies..... bcoz its... superbbb
Hi all, I received the product in 4-5 days of placing the order and as always Flipkart's service and package is rated 5star. Coming to the product, Nexus 2012 is one of the best tablet in the price range and worth paying for it. Go for it..!! :)
Bought it for my nephew for his birthday. He is very happy with the product. excellent service form flipkart
I was impressed how Google could pack so much into such a cheap tablet. Pros: - Good battery life. Lasts upto 24 hours with medium usage. - Awesome display. HD movies are a delight to watch on this tab. - Updated to Android 4.4 KitKat. Brings an infinite number of apps. And a sexy user interface. - The back is very aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. - Stock Android on first boot. So, no unnecessary and cluttering apps all over the home screen. Cons: - Lacks an SD card slot. However, this should not be a problem if 32 gigs will suffice for you. - No HDMI output port. That means this tab can't be connected to the TV. - No call facility. But of course, I personally don't prefer walking in public with a 7" tablet stuck to my ear. - Largely dependent on WiFi. Since 3G feature is missing, not much can be done apart from playing games or navigating an offline map when there is no WiFi signal around.
This is the best tab for the price u pay. Updates itself with android 4.4 kitkat. NO lags. been playing HD games on this and they work perfectly.
This is a great tablet at an awesome price. It has not given any problems and the battery easily lasts for 24 hours. It gives around 27 GB of usable space and supports all the usual apps. I do not intend to use it for any heavy graphic games but games like Deer Hunter run very well.
5 stars rating for Superfast delivery by Flipkart & Nexus device is as like other Nexus products, Highly recommended device.
Everything is good.. Upgadeble to Kitkat Good For Playing Games Nice Touch 32GB Internal is Enough No USB Port/U Have to Buy a OTG cable cost around 90-150 to use USB nice Wifi In One Word "Excellent"
good product but flipkart should offer an stylus free whit this tab overall good in perfomance and must buy tab a very sensitive touch responce and with an android 4.4 kitkat update
I'm not able to play games on this tablet. games are not loading properly and they stuck on loading screen. downloaded many games of larger size e.g. Contract Killer, contract killer 2, minion rush, GTA, Asphalt 8 etc. all these game are stuck on loading screen. Overall bad product for me
2 days flat delivery on COD. Impressed with Flipkart. Product-Good but the wifi connectivity has some issue. Same position, other devices connect far easier. Connected with Google guys, no resolution. Anyways, overall experience is good, could have been better though.
Incredible in design and speed. No disadvantage No lagging. All games run smoothly. Updated to latest android 4.4. Guys go for it.
It's about 2 weeks since my google nexus 7 arrived. The delivery was pretty fast and it's a great tablet. I had been warned by retailers here not to buy it as service for this product is non existent. But having heard so many good things about it I went ahead anyway and so far am happy. The wireless speed is terrific, and it works smoothly. The first time round I had the feeling the battery didn't last too long but I notice that with the second charge it's going longer. Charging time is about 3 hours. I've been using the tab mainly for reading e-books but it's also fine for mailing. Am not into games or anything so can't say much about that.
If you need a device for games and wifi browsing.....NExus 7 is the way to go..Its simple easy and pretty handy
Great built & Amazing quality, Perfect for rooters & Android hard core gamers and of course Great price by Flipkart. Thank you very much Flipkart.
Amazing offer from flipkart. got this awesome gadget for 10k. service was fast. product in good condition. Also, this is the best tablet at such cheap price.
this tablet have bluetooth device ..... and sim support .... plzz tel me that i want to buy this tablet but few imformation has not given so m confused no doubt google tab is awwsme
As always delivered by flipkart at time. Best android product ever. No fuss features in this tab, though it does not have calling features but who uses tab for calling.
this is, hands down, the best android tablet that I have used till date. even though the processor and gpu is almost 2 years old it is blazing fast. android 4.4 works buttery smooth on this tablet. games like asphalt 8 and riptide gp 2 works without the slightest of hickupps or freezing. shopping on flipkart was an excellent experience.
All I can say this a product worth of money you investing. From every aspect I can rate it 10 out of 10. Has 1.5 Ghz nvidia processor, 1gb ddr3 ram.. superfast..never lags whatever game u play. Superb graphics support for watching HD video. Only little problem in the speaker inside it. Sound is low. Battery life is also superb. U can run it almost 1day with whatever operation u want to do.
it has 1 gb ddr3 ram it suks but .... it has12 core gpu and quad core processor total 16 core tablet good one it is official google product so it get update fast.. it is good for developer i ike it ..better then ipad hehe
In this budget this is the best you can get, In india we certainly dont have WI FI available everywhere , in most places it's not there, and if you are a traveller without a phone with a wifi hotspot fecility and 3g , then you better reconsider, else this is an awesome device, While gaming, the tablet heats up a bit, But I guess thats okay keeping in mind the heavy size of them .
nice specification and performance no back camera very good for our price...............................................
everyone who love to read books and play games must have this tablet. the build quality is nice. hardware is good too. great experience using it!
A product worth its price; gorgeous looking; smooth running. A good time saving device, a utility product. Nexus manual that is available online details how to use it for the 'first time' tablet users. The delivery was prompt and the product unscarred. Cons: The screen often blinks: more light to less light; less to more.
Inspite being a shipment problem, The seller has replaced it ASAP and the tablet is one such thing which you cannot avoid buying it!! The Retailer is a prompt seller and looking forward to buy more goods....
Tablet is very nice. I am not a heavy user. So I think battery is also good. Pros: Battery Life Plain android build Cons: Speaker is not that good.
This android tablet represents very good value for money. It is well built and has a good quality feel. It has a clear, high quality display and functions well.
Its a great product in an great pricing, i have updated the android version 4.1 to 4.4 kitkat, and its work very smoothly, truly its an amazing product...
The packing was good. The product was delivered in time as promised. I was bit disappointed when i saw there was a price drop the next day i received it.
Value for money. Cheapest tablet from Google. resolution is a delight at this price point. Delivered in 2 days.
Being the Google's own product, there is nothing to think of. If you have the budget to buy Nexus 2013, go for it or else this is the best option.
IMPORTANT: After unboxing, you may see that the tablet is not turning on for the 1st time and there is no charging indicator when u plug in the charger. DONT PANIC, Usually this product ships with fully discharged battery. So it wont turn on right that moment. Connect your charger and leave it for 1 hour. There may be no charging indicator on screen for 1st 20 mins. Dont worry. after a little charge it will show the charging indicator properly. PROS: Display quite good with good viewing angles. Amoled users may feel color is not that vivid. But that's natural coz it's LCD. Battery backup is awesome unlike samsung and sony tabs.. Sound quality is absolutely awesome. Just use a perfect earphone and install/buy poweramp music player (costs max 120 rupees from playstore. I bought it at 60Rs) and set the equalizer to "ROCK", increase bass 50%, increase treble 100%, increase Stereo X 30%. And you are done. Touch is supersensitive. Processor and ram is more than sufficient. Wifi signal reception power is higher than samsung and sony tabs and phones. NFC works like charm. Instant OS updates from google. Easily rootable and unrootable. CONS: The bundled charger for this tablet says it has 2 Amp output ... But actually it's 1 Amp or less... Coz it charges the device very very slowly. I used Sony 2 Amp charger and it's 3X faster than the bundled charger. No OTG support.
Great product at awesome price. Superfast and best tab available in the market. Flipkart delivery was as usual perfect.
Facing lot of issue while operating Google nexus TAB. Issue : 1) Hanged so many times and issue resolved when i power on/off the button again. 2) Keypad is also not working properly..Not typing same word at a time. 3) Get heated while charging even charger also get heated. 4) Few application start by own and off as well.Looks like device MAD some times. Please either replace the product or return back my money..
I tried calling using skype. The front camera launched but the display of the camera window is freezing.It doesnt show the image at all. I have requested a return from Flipkart.Let us see if they help.
Any one who is considering for a video and audio consumption device should buy this. The display is not very bright but otherwise overall the quality is perfect. absolute no lag, good performace
Till 45 days work flawlessly . After that Touch screen is not working . Device is not in hang state but you can't do any operation apart from screen rotation . Pathetic . Now i need to run for service centers .
Guys its the best android tab out in the market with the best price. I am very happy with this tab. :D
The product is excellent and thanks to flipkart i got the delivery in time to gift it to my father. He is enjoying his movie on the nexus
My friends were saying that nexus does not have a good battery life , but this lasts upto 8 hrs max and supports all games with great graphics , without hesitating you can buy , only thing is that it becomes little hot when you use it for 1 hour continuously. Otherwise it is "PERFECT".....
FLIPKART SERVICE RATING - 10/10 REVIEW - NEXUS 2012 Pros - 1) GREAT DISPLAY - NOT LIKE NEXUS 2013 BUT STILL BEST FOR ITS CLASS 2) PURE ANDROID 3) BUILD QUALITY 4) GAMING - NVIDIA TEGRA 3 5) SIZE - 7INCH GREAT FOR CARRY.(POCKET SIZED/SLIM) 6 )PROCESSOR - QUAD CORE 7) NFC SUPPORT 8) BATTERY SUPPORTS UP 7-8 HOURS Cons - 1) NO SIM SUPPORT 2) NO BACK CAMERA Conclusion - FOR 11.5K GREAT DEAL
Item as described...well packed...delivered on the very next day...works great. Suggest that Flipkart should sell scratch guard also as combo. Also, Flipkart need to provide full technical specification for all the products sold. But for these, it was a very good experience. Thanks.
Item exactly as described. My daughter is very happy with it. Prompt and very fast shipping. Think its the lowest price in this country. The only thing it should have included is call facility. will recommend strongly. God bless flipcart. Regards Meena
using it for almost 5-6 months no issues with the tablet. Easy to use and good screen navigation. Google definitely beat every other tablet in this range
I have been using it for nearly a month and I am completely satisfy with its performance . I have almost stopped using my laptop (except transferring my old stuff to tab) . If you are looking for all in one without calling tab look no further just buy this tab. Web browsing , skype, viber , video chat, games just amazing and the new Nexus 7 has a hidden magnetic lock / unlock functionality like ipad.
pros: thin & light, nice finish material luks premium, good rear grip. nice bright screen, good touch response. cons: battery back up while gaming. heats up quickly during heavy gaming, but thats normal i gues no other tab comes close to what this one provides at this price.. flipkart delivery service awesm..
My apologizes to all the N7 fan boys; but the tab is not all that great as it is hyped to be. It is OK I believe that 8" is the sweet spot of tab screen size so this one might feel smaller to some iboys like me. Another thing the gaming performance is nowhere close to that of the iPad (even the mini). Here is how to improve the lifespan of the N7 1. Invest in a good case, you can never go wrong with that 2. Don't game for long periods, If you see the kind of chip-set in the tab it needs ventilation support which the tab does not have, the chip-set might be able to take the heat but what about the other components? 3. Switch it off when not in use for prolonged period. Believe me guys this is a computer grade hardware and it is always recommended to shut it down when not in use.
There is very nice product but .it have no Sim- card ..so , it is not self working instrument it is depend by WI-Fi ..there is not useful instrument in field work.
First of all great service by flipkart people and also making it available in UP. As for as tablet its a great buy if you want to buy a 7 inch tablet , its fast and buttery smooth Though no 3g but 32gb space,price,performance and brand name make up for it and u can always connect over wifi.
this tablet is awesome guys I am telling you and is much better than apple products but the points comes on the price of the tablet its rs 10999 . I want to tell the flipkart people just reduce the price
Received the product. Overall the performance is good. Fast delivery. It was a good experience to shop with Flipkart.
Pros: 1) Great Display 2) Pure Android by google. So u will get latest updates. 3) Build Quality is nice. Also has premium looks. Cons: 1) Bit heavy 2) Back Camera would be an nice addition. Conclusion: For 11.5k it is definitely worth buying.
My nexus 32GB is about 3 months old and ma screen got cracked.How do i get it replaced and changed. I need a reply soon coz the tablet is really useful and i don't want to waste time. The tablet is awesome.
Excellent tablet. User friendly. Good resolution. Excellent price. I love this tablet. Good buy from Flipkart.
its been a month since im using this tablet , felt very satisfied for its amazing features at such a low price, dropped my precious for a few times but not even a scratch..again thumbs up for its built quality. my only complain with this product is that it has a very small charging wire which hinders me from my sleeptime entertainment. NEXUS 7 ZINDABAAD !
4 Stars for the Nexus 7 2012 tablet. It is awesome VFM. Reducing 1 star for not have SIM card slot. 1 Star has been reduce for the seller because when I opened the back cover, I found distinct Finger Prints on one of the parts inside, which could mean that someone played with it and it is NOT A NEW product or it is a REFURBISHED one. I use it occasionally for web browsing, checking emails, hangouts, playing games, etc. It is mostly used by my son who enjoys playing lot of games and reading ebooks. I find the tab to be good enough for the above purpose. I would recommend the product, however, I am not sure about the seller.
First of all thanks to Flipkart, for making available this device in stock. i was looking it in market (Nehru Place, Delhi) so that i can margin in its price. But unfortunately, it wasn't available in their stock. so i ordered it through flipkart, i was keep tracking this device through my tracking order number. finally, after 2 days, i received this. i was so excited. Successfully Updated it in Kitkat 4.4.2.. But unfortunately, pure KitKat having some bugs, related to third party camera apps, such as Skype, well Skype is working fine, but in background its eating my tab's battery.. giving me talktime of 5 to 6 hours.. After searching thousand of forums, i found that i am not all alone. many Kitkat users having same battery issue with their devices.. (Moto G users also).. Then i checked google's forum and other News website, Google is trying to release 4.4.3 to make it bugs free.. Lets come to the device. This is really a super fast tab i have ever seen, even my friend have Galaxy Tab, its better than any other tabs of stupid Samsung. HD video watching experience is awesome, its Display can make you enjoy all types of HD Video without a single leg. Wi-Fi is good, can catch far better signals as compare to my old phone. Camera quality is OK OK. well i dont need camera too much, i own DSLR.. Overall good product in budget.. i bet you guys anyone can fall in love with this device, even my mobile shopkeeper also ordered it for his personal use.. Here is my rating for its features.. Battery : 7/10 Camera : 6/10 Design : 9/10 Connectivity : 10/10 Sound : 8/10 Gaming : 10/10 Multitasking : 10/10 Screen : 15/10 (Woaaaaaahhhh) Weight : 8/10 (lil bit heavy, but you'll love it at the time of sensor gaming) Updates : 10/10 Buy it : 1. If you love playing Games. 2. Want to jealous all of your friends 3. HD Display. 4. Wi-Fi user. (it required wi-fi for signup/signin to Play store for the first time, btw you can skip this step) Dont Go for this. Well, i think there is no reason for not buying it.. after all you are going to experience a better new technology.. Thanks for reading.. :)
I purchased this product with specific object of replacing my aging PC. To use this tab instead of PC for day to day usage. It has met my expectation except low battery life needs frequent recharging as compared to my expectation and the OTG cable could not be used until and unless you download a paid app.
The product is a good buy given the price. The tab is of good build, superior display, and a great configuration.
I bought a 32gb version nexus 7 2012 from flipkart.Initially i received a faulty product which was replaced in a week through easy replacement policy. The tab itself was stunning for the money paid. I bought this tab for my 9 month old son. We used to feed him by playing rhymes &video songs in it,He stops crying whenever i play a video from it. It is a must have for parents with toddler who wants to keep their little one happy.Most important thing is the tab works very well even after brutally abused everyday by my little one. Thank you flipkart for selling a nice product in a very reasonable price ?
Nexus 7 with 32 GB is a good to go daily use tablet. Tegra 3 performance is very good and this tablet is quite responsive and more than worth the cost. Use this for gaming, daily use and entertainment along side your work. If you are a geek you could install Ubuntu and start towards convergence. The docking pin will help u more towards convergence. Android 4.2 Jelly bean would suffice for all users. For advanced users looking at hacking the hardware, you can look at ARM version of debian or debian based kali linux.
Gr8 Assurance again unbelievable product best in the business quality at due deliverance . Thank you vendor, gr8 time lines.
A great device...it does not come loaded with all the junks you get in a Sony, Samsung devices....Extremely smooth and easy to use...Google Now is amazing....Resolution is quite good at this price...you have around 28 GB of user available storage...what more do you want at this price??...need to install some android games to take advantage of the Geforce GPU and Tegra chipset....One word of caution for those who receive a device with zero battery charge...please get a samsung 150-300V smartphone charger to charge up the device...I received mine with zero charge and so connected it to the in-box charger and waited for one hour before starting it...and when I push the power button...it just showed screen flickering and I sorta panicked...but I then decided to plug in my samsung note 2 charger and voila the device started up....and one more advice crying that the device doesn't have SD card slot...Get a USB OTG and buy the Nexus Media Importer from Google Play....and you will have all the storage you want...I connected my Seagate Backup Plus and its good to go...enjoy the device...don't overwork it....and I am sure it wll stay alive for quite sometime....
Don't expect an awesome table if it has NVidia quad core processor it ain't that impressive Got 13000 on antutu benchmark Rest is amazing nic display' Plays HD 1080p video's and some HD games
The only defect is it doesn't have the back camera. So please make sure you are aware of it. rest all is fine
Its a super smooth and great on performace tablet, and with the slim looks for others to envy.Its a great tablet and worth every penny of your purchase.
Very Nice,fast good performance 32 GB storage tablet in Rs.10,999. Now I have updated my tablet to Android 4.4 & there are lot of free Apps in android market. Graphics are very nice & gaming performance is also very smooth.I am fully satisfied with this device.
I bought this product at 15k.Here are my views: 1)This device has the worst display and build quality.While using,you will find cracks on the displays,lines etc, even after gentle use. 2.)Dont trust asus.coz they say its corning glass.but scratches occur easily. 3.)very low sound. 4.)after sales support from flipkart. 5.)no warranty. pros:) 1.)good battery back up. So,hereby I will never trust asus and never buy anything from flipkart....
Product is not upto the satisfatory price................................... keeps on hanging............ memory space is also not good................................................... and many more
The product is faulty. After 2 months of usage the nexus tablet stopped working. Lately I heard feedback from other people also that electronics products from flipkart tends to be faulty. Look for other sites.
i want to purchase this product but i don't no the quality of this product please help me some one this is good product
This is a very good tablet with good quality. None of the tablets around this price range is comparable, it is way above. The processor, speed, response and display were awesome. Battery should provide more backup, but other tablets in this price range giving just 1/3 times compare to this. Camera is not up to the expectation. Tablet does not have all the latest features. It will be better if available for lesser price.
It has lot of Google apps installed, like Google Music, Download Manager, etc. After disabling all Google bloat, it has long battery life, no unnecessary data usage and so smooth. Best for gaming and fine for ebook reading.
This is a long post. Read it if you're interested in knowing about my pleasant experience with Flipkart's (WS Retail) replacement guarantee. I recently purchased a Google Nexus 7 tablet from Flikpart on 4th March 2014. The tablet was delivered on time and I was really happy using it. But a couple of weeks later I saw that there was a dead pixel on the screen. As it was right in the middle of the screen, it was really annoying. So I decided to opt for a replacement, as items sold by WS Retail have a 30 day replacement guarantee. Read on... Day 1: I called Flipkart at around 9:30AM and told them that I had an issue with my tab and asked for a replacement. I was promised a call back within 24 hours. With the kind of impatient person I am, I decided to send them some tweets regarding this too. After 3-4 tweets, I finally got a reply that I will be called back soon. Day 2: It had already been 24 hours and I was getting paranoid by now. I called Flipkart again and I was promised a call back soon. I tweet them angrily few more times, send an email and also wrote a very "angry" post on their Facebook wall expressing my disappointment of not getting a call back within 24 hours. I am really starting to get worried here and all kinds of thoughts like "they will never replace my tab, I have to live with this defective tab now" blah blah started creeping in my mind. Finally after around 30 hours since I first called them, I got a call back from a Flipkart representative. I was super elated. The representative apologized for the inconvenience politely and asked me what was the issue with my tab. I explained and after a few basic questions, he approved my refund! I was relieved. And within 2 hours of this call, I got an email that WS Retail had already shipped my replacement tab via Bluedart. Bluedart tracking showed delivery by 26th March. My faith in Flipkart which had gone bleak since the last 24 hours started getting stronger again. Day 3: There was some mobile network outage whole day in my area and in the evening when network returned to normal, I got a text from their courier partner ekart that they tried to contact me for the reverse pickup but couldn't reach my phone. The text also mentioned that a pickup would be attempted tomorrow. Day 4: At around 12:30PM the ekart pickup guy arrives and I hand over the defective tablet to him. He examines and packs it and hands me over an acknowledgement. I was bit sad that I had to live without a tab till 26th March (expected delivery of my replacement tab). But to my pleasant surprise, while I was closing the gate after the ekart pickup guy left, two Bluedart guys arrive with my replacement Nexus 7! 4 days before the expected delivery date! I couldn't believe that this was actually happening! I signed the consignment receipt and came inside with a big smile on my face. I open the package and saw a brand new, shining, sealed Nexus 7 inside. I turn it on and its working like it should and I'm typing all this with a happy and smiling face on my Nexus 7! So within 4 days, I got my defective tablet replaced. Thank you, Flipkart for fulfilling your commitment before expected time limits and over exceeding my expectations. Damn, I started doubting Flipkart for the first time since 2012 (when I placed my first order with them) and they have put all my doubts to rest efficiently and with perfection. Love you, Flipkart. I am so happy that I might send some return gifts to Flipkart! Thanks to the Flipkart executives who attended my calls, their social media team for bearing my angry posts and tweets and always replying with extreme politeness and a sense of assurance. Thumbs up, guys!
I bought it from flipkart a mnth ago and I am fully satisfied with its performance. Game performance is too good. it is able to play any video even 1080. Battery backup is awsme, for an average use u can get an 1.5 day or 2 day battery power. Display quality is also good & an good viewing angle. The defects are for an net connection u hve only an wifi, device will get hot at the back bottom when u r playing high end games, no rear camera and also memoryis not expandable
This is THE best android tablet available in the 15,000 price bracket. Period. If you are looking for a tablet with 15,000 (for 32 GB) just buy it without even thinking about samsung or micromax. Positives: 1. Excellent build quality, easy and comfortable to hold in one hand 2. Thin and light-weight, very portable (you can carry it in your jean's backpocket) 3. Very sharp display, very nice color 4. Very powerful quad-core processor and nvdia 12 core gpu that makes this product deliver performance without any lag 5. Google stock android 4.4.2 kitkat update the moment you power on the device and trust me its again an awesome software from Google 6. Good sound quality from speaker and headphones 7. Great battery life 8. Good wifi connectivity All in all i am very satisfied with the product and recommend it whole heartedly.
very happy with flipkart's fast delivery this tablet is really value for money but its charger is not working hope problem will be resolved soon
the nexus 7 ,got in to my hands earlier than the estimated delivery date,time to review pros: 1)people who want to have an decent tab for the price of 10k go for nexus7 (2012) because by far this is the best tab for such a low price and its worth waiting for few more days because the price may drop by 1K 2)people who want to choose between nexus 7 and dell venue 7 go for nexus 7 becz the venue 7 display sucks in real time ,and venue 7 is running 4.2 and hope they are not gonna update it to 4.3 ,battery sucks in venue 7 so its obvious to choose nexus 7 3)google OTA updates cons: 1)When we fill up storage to the point of having less than around 3GB free, the firmware triggers a process that runs "unusually slow and can lock up the whole device for several seconds." 2) there are many cases reporting that the nexus 7 is getting slower and slower after few months ,may be hardware issue in some tablets 3)display edges are too delicate and more accident prone ,need to handle with care 4)multiple reboots and battery drain is most common after 4 months
best tablet under 15k. if you can afford nexus 2013 great. if not forget samsung etc just buy this tablet.
Its worth paying, iam happy with this product. So easy to carry and comfortable to use. So comfortable to read books.
Really nyc to have this Nexus..! If there is a Primary camera..! then this will rocks ..! Good vedio clarity and sound..! Browsing speed gud with WiFi
There is nothing to say wrong with the product at the flipkart price. The great thing is that the service provided by the flipkart is incomparable. Even most of popular shopping sites can't provide satisfaction at this much extent. Now my first and final preference is flipkart. About the product. As owned by Google, that is sufficient to say that product will be amazing. Nice clarity and best resolution with compatible hardware configuration. Well satisfied at the price of INR 10,999.00
THe wifi does not turn on once i have updated to kitkat. I have to manually reboot the device before it is able to connect to wifi.
Google nexus a great tablet easy to use easy to maintain.... very helpful in daily routine work. and the price is just appropriate as compare to its other tablets in market....
great and easy to use. recommended for lite users. Have been using it for a week now without a hitch. Lack of primary camera is a hindrance but does not greatly devalue the product
No words to praise ....... It's a master piece at a damn cheap price. Hats off to Google and ASUS. I Thank all the people who were behind the development of this product.
Very neat. Does what is expected. No significant cons. Just the adapter failed and had to get a replacement. Otherwise will recommend this
Please do not buy this product. i bought this two weeks ago and the screen is just too fragile. it broke already. it fell on the bed and the whole screen cracked. i will not recommend this tab to anyone unless you can really take care too well. i will give the built quality a 1.
Awesome tab. It's having the same graphic card which is in Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 You should buy it if you are a true android gamer..Thumbs Up
Purchased this product after a lot of research & so far satisfied with its performance(15 days). Here am mentioning a few cons & hopefully it may help fellow buyers- 1.It is a old model manufactured around March-13(all most all nexus shipped by Ws retail) ,Therefore product you gonna use is getting switched on after a long idle time & this hampers its battery performance drastically.No where near what Nexus claims. Even less than 30% brightness & a minimum app running background i am getting around 5-6 hour when the screen is on continuously. 2. Android app market for tablet is bullshit.. a lot are just a stretched version of mobile & it looks very awkward on the tablet. 3.Inbuilt sound is less but if use earphone(good pair in the earphone) that will solve your problem. 4.I am not impressed by the screen resolution its not crisp & somewhat faded...May be my eye acquainted to high ppi on my smartphone. 5.It's getting a hot while charging. 6.Occasional lag(Android has this inherited problem) but not a concern for non gamer like me. Overall value for money..If you can cope with these problems than go make a purchase right now. Am satisfied with flipkart service but they should refrain from cheap pricing policy if they want to build long term relation with their customer.I purchased this tablet at Rs.11499 & just after a couple of days price get reduced by rs.500.
Its been a week using this tab. Awesome is the word for this tablet with respect to the price. Not writing the specs, but the experience I have got so far - Pros - - Display is good with Gorilla glass, offering peace of mind against scratches. But a screen is recommended. - Tegra 3 is awesome with respect to response. No lags what so ever. Also, 1 GB DDR3 is doing its work quite effectively. - Instant upgrade to 4.4.2 Kitkat is icing on the cake. You will also get future updates. - Played NOVA 3, Riptide GP2 on this one. Absolute beauty. You will love this tab for how it handles graphics. - Battery is good. The initial charge was quick & also the drain :) but evventually the battery started behaving normally with 2-2.5 hrs to recharge & good backup of atleaes a day with moderate to heavy use. - Very portable. One hand grip is perfect. also, the screen orientation for portrait to landscape is flawless, even in the home screen. - Rubberized perforated back is good to hold & gives a premium feel. - Those who are looking for storage, buy the 32 GB as you will get 28.5 free space available. And remember this is a tablet & not a laptop ;) - 3G was not my requirement. In case you need to use net on the go, use your smartphone as a WiFi Hotspot. You are good to go. Cons - - I couldn't find this product in local market. Had to use Flipkart instead. Even the accessories were not available. Used eBay to order a cover & screen guard. - Not sure about ASUS service in NCR region. Final Verdict - an absolute beauty at this price range. Won't disappoint you in performance/looks/handling/android updates/portability/backup etc etc... The list goes on n on as I use it further ;) Enjoy!!
As usual Flipkart service was very fast and good.... About Tablet - awesome tablet till now...... NO cons. my view about the processor is that its very fast with 1.2 GHz Quad core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor with 1 GB RAM..... HD display with very good viewing angles.... Front 1.2 MP camera for online chatting..... 32 GB inbuilt memory so no worries about heavy graphics intensive games and runs without any lags..... I dont care about real camera because I own a DSLR camera..... And most imp. it supports OTG without ROOT.... I'm using USB keyboard and mouse + Pendrives.....I'm using this tablet for my office use instead of bulky laptops.... U can go for it....
Back in November 2013 I bought this product from flipkart with a reasonable price. It's my 2nd tablet,former Galaxy Tab 2 P3100. Here are some experience of mine hope this'll help you to judge before buy this product. The first thing I would say about this is The best of Google in a tablet with a decent price offer from Flipkart.If you are in a tight budget then there is no better option except this. Powered by Nvidia Tegra 3 processor with 4+1 core coupled with 1Gigs of RAM which is more than enough for multitasking and gaming purpose. You can play all high end games without any issue. Good battery life and protected by a Gorilla Glass to save your money from buying a screen guard. Decent resolution with 217ppi density to display a sharp quality of picture. thanks to Google for it's Kitkat update and thanks to Flipkart and WS retail for brought this Product to us.
very gud experience with flipkart thumbsup to flipkart service, the tab is much effective very gud sleek design no heat problemz, gud graphics very gud audio output battery iam not sure of it hope it wud last for a day for heavy usage
The tablet is amazing in this price range, Absolutely no complaints. Works like a dream...very smooth interface. Got delivered within 2 days.

It is almost a month now I am using Google Nexus 7 - 32 GB 2012 Tablet. Pros: - For a price of Rs.11 K the Tablet is very good. The quality of material used is too good. Cons: - The charging cable is too short in length Kudos to Flipkart for the ontime delivery and very good packaging. Keep up the good work!

Good product...upgradeable to 4.4.2... Best tab to buy ...best for gaming and reading...Thanks FlipKart
I really was impressed really by the packaging and all those stuff from flipkart first and foremost. And then after I stripped everything off I just was amazed to see the thing at my palms... A SLENDER PERFECTLY DESIGNED MARVEL AT A STEAL OF A PRICE.... as others have reviewed earlier I see no difference from what most of them have experienced before. It really packs a deathstrike punch for what it offers. Glossy looks, Scratch resistant, Crisp sharp display, Powerful processor, Smooth performance and all that... you name it it does it... Buy of the decade easily. Its a trend setter in every sense of imagination for what it does.
This is my second nexus device that I buy from Flipkart.. feels solid and portable.. great for reading books and playing games also watching hd videos was simply fun. definite buy!
Product is too good. My mom is using this product and find it very easy to operate. Mainly we use for playing games, videos, songs. Nice packaging. Super fast delivery.
first kudos to flipkart for ultra fast delivery. second, about the tablet. it sure is one of the best budget tablet and the purest android experience makes it more enjoyable. simplicity is its trademark and is sure not feel outdated from any angle inside and out. go for it.
After couple of months this will not start i.e, not boot. Same happened with my friend also. If you want to buy then you have to take care of battery, as soon as it is 20% charge it. Once it's shutdown you should be lucky to so that it starts working again. And I was not lucky
Absolutely useless piece of hardware at exorbitant cost. There are much better tabs available at lower cost. The price is too high for outdated hardware.
About flipkart: -------------------- good packaging and fast delivery to say the least. Delivered in 2 days. About the product: -------------------------- Pros: Good pricing Vanilla Android and quick updates Awesome developer support USB OTG (with root) HD resolution screen (1280 * 800 pixels) Good battery stand-by Good gaming experience Cons: A washed out display (problem with all Nexus 7 2012) Connectivity (No wi-fi direct & cannot transfer stuff via bluetooth, other than multi-media files) Sunlight legibility The way I see it, you just cannot get a better product at this price point. This tablet is bloody smooth.
I bought the Asus Google Nexus 7 2012 32GB Wi-Fi edition nearly a month ago. Main reason to buy this particular tablet being stock AOSP UI, latest firmware (4.4.2) and the ability to install custom ROMs and finally Ubuntu Touch support. Overall a pretty good 7" tablet in 10K range
EXCELLENT DISPLAY ZIPPY PROCESSOR EASY TO USE FAST UPGRADES..etc etc etc etc etc etc just go for it guys :P
With the price being just 11k. it is a tablet worth buying. I had some problem with the first tablet I had, but flipkart was very prompt in replacing the same with a new one and now this new one hasn't given me any problem. Just go for it.
The product is as mentioned. There are no flaws as far as I have used. My mom is really happy with the device (except for the heaviness she feels after using it for more than 1 hr) The device's bottom section heats up after prolonged usage. Apart from that, I recommend it to anyone who wants an alternate for playing and app using tablet
I have taken this product recently, it looks like it's good product. battery and other stuff are good as well, only thing that sometime I missed like there is no SIM card option , so we have to depend on WI-FI network only.
Great for reading and watching movie also you can play games. Its little heavy also the back get hot when you play games
nice product but faced issues with battery back-up and flipkart has E-techies...who are incompetent to troubleshoot for hardware issues by askng to factory restore for battery issues.... that was funny... and flipkart never able to fox the issue... if someone wants to buy a product and be stuck with it if any issues are there.... then buy from flipkart...
I like Product description is very good I like it very much, i will try to get it back after some time, I will give it five out of five marks as symbol of feedback, many many thanks fizzkart thanks
2012 model was cheaper, but not much different from 2013. So basically, a good value for money. Personally, I think Google Nexus is pretty cool if you are not a blind Apple fan. I would any day buy this over a I Pad or I Pad Mini.
finally my wait is over. thanks flikart for the wow service as always. apart from front cam and sim support, its best in class. what more you expect within 10K(16g). pretty much happy and enjoying. the only concern i have about this product as what technique should i use to configure m Dongle with this. tried hell lot of option to get it configued like. SuperSU, superuser. nothing seems to be working. for pendrive PPP seems to be working. Any idea guys. plese revert me with suggestion. thanks.
This is one of the best Tab in the Market comparable to I pad mini. Impressive performance and usability.
I have been using this tab for last 6 months and it is working more than expected. I have been playing and also finished some like NFS,GTA,Asphalt,Carmegddon,Earn to Die and many more games. If your looking for an ultimate tab and at a good price,then go for this one. I am assured that this nexus 2012 is an ultimate winner in his class in his time.
The best tab you can ever buy. No second thoughts for buying this. Bought this and fell in love. Instant upgrade to KITKAT 4.4.2 soon after connecting to wifi. Five stars
I bought nexus 7 one month back. Updated it to 4.4 KitKat. The performance of the tablet is impressive.apps run smooth. Very less lag. Some of the problems I noticed while using it is it does not allow apk files to share over Bluetooth or wifi direct. No file sharing is possible over WiFi direct. So connectivity is not good on this tablet. Only Bluetooth works for sharing which is very slow. All the apps and games run smooth. No rear camera is a problem at this price. Battery backup is good but not up to the mark. It give 4+ hours of screen on time. No built in application for reading pen drive. So you have to buy an app forrs 200 for using otg on this. No dongle support is a headache on this device. Other than that all things are good.
If you are for a tablet within 15k then you should seriously consider this tablet ! Pure android , regular updates, good build quality:)
Ho Just brought a Nexus 7 from Flipkart The piece is not switching on , charged for 7 hrs still not working Called Flipkart service at 3 pm today they promised to call back no answer Poor Customer service- called again they promised to call back in 24 hrs -Where is the famed Flipkart service -Daughter Bday and have a dud Nexus 7 thanks to Flipkart
Firstly, thank you Flipkart for the excellent-as-always service. The Nexus: I was torn between the Lenovo A3000 and the discounted Nexus 7 2012. It's been about a month i've had this now. I'm not still completely over the A3000. I'll buy it if i have some extra money later. I went for the Nexus on account of the differences in processor and display. Con? The Nexus automatically downloads the latest Android, whenever connected to the Net. This can't be disabled or delayed. I spent about 700Mb of my 3g data plan while it upgraded from 4.2.2 (pre-installed) to 4.3 (or was it 4.4?), and then to 4.4.2. Only after these upgrades could i begin using the device in earnest. But i forgive this behaviour, though, as being a price to pay for free Android upgrades. Another con perhaps? The 3.5mm audio port is a "headphone" port, i.e. audio-out. It is not a "headset" port. It cannot take in mic input from a headset. So while on a Skype call, for instance, you can listen to the other party's audio via headphones. But when you speak, your voice has to be captured by the in-built mics. They are pretty sensitive, so you don't have to speak too loud, and can maintain reasonable privacy. But it felt bad to miss out on this (basic?) feature all the same. After the Kitkat upgrade, i was able to use the Nexus Media Importer (the paid version) and an OTG cable, and use my USB flash media. Considering that with earlier versions of Android, this was only possible with rooting, this was a good plus point. I only use the device for light weight Net browsing and book-reading. The rest of the family uses it for watching nursery rhymes and cartoons and Skype. So at the moment i'm happy with it, though as i mentioned, not really ecstatic about it. But again, thank you, Flipkart.
Hi, Anyone using this tab can u please tell me whether this Tab Support USB datacard for internet browsing??
This is best one in 10K range. I am using it from last one month and didn't find any issue yet. Battery backup and performance is also good. Got delivered in good condition from flipkart and extremely satisfied with my decision to go for it.
Please note that although I have a 16GB unit, as per the reviewers' comments received earlier, tried installing Paid application "Nexus Media Importer " for reading / playing contents from a Memory stick thru' OTG cable....Must say it was very good. Hence without rooting, just by paying ~200 bucks, we can utilise this application for interfacing with a Memory stick.
Bought this for my grandparents for mostly offline multimedia use, skype and games. Experience has been good so far. Drawback is mostly the battery life. I wish it gave longer standby time.
It has been 15 days since I bought this product. I felt this is worth the money spent. If budget is tight and if we keep the 3G aside then go for this..
Had a hard time choosing between nexus 7 2012 and 2013 and ultimately bought this one. Well nexus 7 2013 is no doubt better than 2012 but the question is..is it worth the extra money(around 10k extra). The only advantage that 2013 has over 2012 is the screen resolution. Yes the processor too but not a big difference. I am glad I opted for 2012 over 2013. Service was excellent.
Hi friends, 1 week back i purchased Google Nexus 7 2012 with 32 gb from flipkart for Rs. 11,500. Its a good tablet and best for gaming . This 7 inch tablet is good for gaming. I have played ASPHALT 8, REAL RACING 3, NFS MOST WANTED and many games. Its a good tablet and happily can purchased. Good The best thing in Nexus Tabs or Phones is updating the software is available Working Good & delivery is fast. Bad No Slim card, no expandable memory card, camera is normal, regards, Chiluka Srinivas Rao, Hayathnagar, Hyderabad.
I have been using this tab for nearly a month now. I use it mostly for reading, videos, music, rounds of crushing candies and communication purposes. Battery is good. I have heard about charging issues, but touch wood, nothing I faced yet. And I hope it continues to be so, knock on wood. Have seen Skype crash once in 20 times. But not sure who's the culprit. Strong built has also been tested twice. Front camera suffices for its duties towards me. I am a little skeptic about how microphone performs. The two mic points have been average so far. Comfortable grip. Very clear speaker. Audio output is great too. At times while multitasking, play music hangs in between, producing noise, hurting my ears. Else, all other apps work just fine. Haven't seen no lags, hangs or crashes than the ones mentioned. Summing up, I'm satisfied!
Really happy to use this awesome tablet. So far everything is good. I am surprised that how Google can sell such a quality tablet for this price range! We cannot get anything else as BEST as this. A real value for money tablet. Pros: 1. Price - wow 2. Build quality - super 3. Battery - good 4. Performance - super 5. Hardware utilization/optimization - wow Cons: (not really much) 1. Heating, while on wifi - usual with many tablets and smart phones 2. Size/Thickness - not bad, but could be better 3. Nothing To be frank, I can easily list PROS, but struggled to think about CONS. I think that make you understand the power of this Nexus 7. If you have plans to buy tablet between 15,000 to 25,000, you can happily go for it. Worth investment, without any second thoughts... Happy buyer...
Excellent product for the stated price! Gr8 screen resolution and touch sensitivity! Definitely recommended product.
Excellent tab with a very good battery life and a very decent price. Worth a buy instead of any budget tablet.
It is just superb at a superb price. Good quality, no lags, and just everything u can imagine :) Best part was the delivery time by Flipkart.
The best thing in Nexus Tabs or Phones is updating the software is much easier... Thanks for the best pricing.. WS Retail.. Working Good. Good to use. Delivery was quick. Happy!
Asus Nexus 1st gen. tab is amazing. Comfortable to hold, comparatively light weight & slim. Many pros here, but the issue I am facing with this tablet is its slow charging. Initially the tablet charging was smooth, but after about 20 days the tablet charged dead slow (5 to 7 % per hour). I read online many reviews globally for solution, but to my surprise there is no solution to this yet & many people are facing similar issues. Although sometimes it charges smoothly but its very annoying most of the times, also the battery drops while charging if the tablet is active. Overall the tablet is excellent apart from this annoying charging problem. I would have definitely rated it a 5 star, but wont due to the charging problem. Again the Flipkart service is up to mark. WS retail is the best!
Awesome tablet; good for gaming too Just feeling alive after a long while playing , great graphics WORTH BUYING
Very nice tablet it's value for money awsome performance it has very nice build quality upgradeable to kitkat 4.4.2 the only drawback is that it does not have back camera
As i had expected, Google Nexus 7 is one of the better tablets in the market. Buy without any hesitation for you wont be disappointed at all. Pros: Perfect size, large enough for watching movies, small enough to be held comfortably. Impressive battery backup, i charge mine once every two-three days with moderate usage. Play Store! Android Openness. Cons: Occasional Android performance lags. No sim card slot (but i guess if you decide to buy it, doesn't really matter for you) Overall, a nice robust tablet available at amazing price!!
Good product coupled with good service and makes the customer delight. Absolutely loving the tablet.
Pros: Good design and build quality Fast for a average user Tested Games like Asphalt - Runs decently Cons Battery lasts for about 2 - 3 hrs under heavy gaming
I had been thinking of buying this NEXUS from past couple of months and finally one day decided to click on Buy Now button. So far a good experience with this Tab. Got upgadded to latesr KitKat OS after initial setup. I will use it for next couple of weeks and will give a full review on the my experience on NEXUS 7...
Its performance is simply wonderful.The display quality is awesome especially considering its price tag. the Android got automatically updated to its latest version kitkat within a matter of days.Reading books on 7" screen is a pleasure after choosing "Sepia" or " night" mode. The processor is reasonably fast.The Hangout or Skype work fine.
The pros: The touch is very smooth, it does not hang, & thanks to the processor heavy applications also play effectively. The major negative I felt was that it is missing the back camera due to which clicking photos is not an option. Secondly there is no slot for a sim card, so you need to be in a wifi zone to access the internet. In the given price it is a good buy especially if you are looking for a good processor.
This us unbelievable. Flipkart delivered by with in One Day. This is awesome. Keep it up Flipkart. And also this is really great tablet with 11K range. My kid is enjoying a lot. lot many futures. what else you expect with this price range..... ?
Great product from Asus. Except for lack of Good cover in market, everything about. Nexus 7 is good..
Thank you Flipkart for your amazing service. I got the product within 2 days of my order. You guys rock. I have been using this product since 1 week and am really impressed by the speed and fluidity of this tablet. 1. The first thing you will notice is the display. Its simply amazing with 1280X800 pixels concentrated in 7'. The text, images, HD videos all look delightful not to forget, its gorilla glass. 2. Got updated to Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat) right after I connected to my WIFI. The entire over the air update was smooth and without any glitch and finished within an hour. 3. Temple Run 2, Subway Surfers, Asphalt 8 or anything runs perfectly smooth. Surprisingly I found Wordament from my Windows Phone to my absolute delight. 4. Battery life is between 6 to 7 hours on moderate usage and 3 to 4 hours on heavy usage. I could go for an entire day with a single charge with casual mail checks and Facebook browsing. 5. No heating issues or any kind of lag noticed so far. 6. At Rs.9500/- its definitely the best tablet in the market with Quadcore processor, 1 Gb Ram, 16 Gb memory and a stunning HD display. However few things may sound a deal breaker for some. 1. Only WIFI version available now. That's not much of an issue, as most people have a smartphone with them and they can always share their phone's internet with the Nexus 7. 2. No rear camera available. I don't need it anyway. Totally in love with this product. Get one, before a smarter one gets it.
I have done a very big mistake buying this nexus 7 (2012 version) few months ago. Please don't buy this product, there is a problem with the touch glass (not LCD). It will break at anytime even without any mishandling (it is very delicate). Usually you will see cracks developed at the corners at starting and they may creep to the centre, bringing the LCD malfunction finally. Flipkart anyway doesn't give any warranty for this, even ASUS or Google nexus also say this is not covered under warranty. For my surprise the ASUS authorised service centres in bangalore are charging exactly Rs.9500 , just for this touch screen glass, which more than the Nexus 7/16GB total device.I have seen many complaints with this touch glass breaking problem. Better you go for Kindle fire, although it is 1 or 2 thousands more.
very nice TAB....preety decent battery, screen resolution is also good compared to other TABs No problem while playing big size games...
I have no words to xplain my joy to be a proud owner of such a great tablet in just Rs 10999/- . The credit goes to flipkart and google-asus combination. Battery, Display, Browsing performance, Gaming, Handiness, Looks everything is in the double positive side. Real combination of Value for money, Performance, Brand, Technology and above all Satisfaction without a single regret. If u r searching for a tab without call facilities then THIS IS IT . Feel the best .......
The product is good, clarity wise, speed wise. But prefer a sim version in the same model. Internet usuage is also pretty fine to use. This is the cheaper one I belive which has good features
Pros: Feather smooth, no hanging, HD display, long battery life, good for games n movies Neg: no data except WiFi, no otg option
Great product with great delivery. You can definitely go for this if you are looking for a table (without calling facility)
I dont play much games but use the tab for reading digital books and magazine, do surfing and listen to the music etc... watch vidoes as well... It has become a must have for me now.... i really think its great value for money!
I really bought this for experimenting with some android roms and just general PDF viewing. As far as the product goes in concern, it does have a teeeeny bit of lag in the UI as compared to the nexus 4 or nexus 5 but nothing severe as often seen on flagship samsung phones. Oh and being a nexus, I immediately got the 4.4.2 update after the initial setup of the device right of of the box! One downside though is the it lacks the rear camera, but that was not a deal breaker for me. If you are looking for a tablet in this price range, I would suggest this one for sure!
So I bought this from Flipkart , got delivered in 3 days ( BTW i live in Kerala ) . The tablet itself is probably the best you can get at this price . Pros: -Awesome battery life , lasts days if you stick to light weight duties like music and net browsing . -Mind blowing processing power , i play really graphics heavy 3D games like NFS Most Wanted and Asphalt and the graphics looks as good as in a low end PC ! -Space ..... 32 GB , need i say more ?? after I've loaded everything i need I've still got 5 GB left ... Cons - A little heavy , arms could get tired after a while holding it for long periods of time - Charging take a while , but that might be due to the big fat 4325mAh battery - Might get addicted to mobile 3D gaming .... lol
I am using this tablet for some months now. It has an absolute smooth and fluidic operation. A good vibrant display. Has not given any problem. I have played some demanding games without any lagging. The only drawback is that it does not have expandable memory otherwise it deserved full 5 stars in its category and at this price point.
purchased 2 of them on flipkart. both turned up DOA !!!! ASUS/GOOGLE standards of QA !!! flipkart took back and refunded the money on the wallet. settled for the micromax p650. thats worth the buy.
I have used only 4 days. pros Good display Good finish very good speed good sound quality cons 1) Without internet the device is of no use. 2) No otg cable is included with the product. 3) I dont like the added security (you can't share apps through bluetooth) 4) i want to disable all the graphics and animations to increase the battery. But i can't find a solution. 5) No sim card slot. I am not bothered about this feature before purchasing the device but as using i cant find a wifi hotspot everywhere in India. 6) A number of unwanted apps are installed in the tab which i will not use at least for once in my life. 7) Full hd .mkv files cannot be played. Verdict This tab is best for them who need a tab to read eBooks, play games,listen music,and watch standard quality video. Not for them who need internet everywhere with the tablet.
This is my sister's birthday gift and she loves playing games on it. Even I use this to play HD Games and they run very fluently with any lag. Battery is very good and good enough to HD play games for a long duration. I thought that 1GB of RAM would be less for handling my heavy games but this tablet proved me wrong because of Nvidia Tegra 3. I updated my Nexus to Android 4.4.2[Kitkat] and its simply awesome.
I am very happy with the product , delivers what it says. Most of the games rum smoothly. The only con i think is connectivity but it is offset by great experience of hardware and software, can't get my hands off it. :) Although i am finding it difficult to locate a good cover for it :P
Nexus 7 (2012 - 32GB) is a great product to own. Battery life is awesome. Speaker is not very good (very low volume). Automatic android update is an added advantage. Worth every penny.
It is very nice. The processing speed is very good. I recommended it for gaming. Asphalt 8 runs so smoothly. the size is more than 1 GB.
I think this is one of the best tabs one can buy on a tight budget. Highly recommended at the Flipkart Price.
awesome device ! i bought my nexus 7 from flipkart and its an amazing device that you can buy for such a low price. no other tablet compares to the specifications and features of this tablet upto the price range of Rs25k. i would say if u are looking to purchas.e a tab upto 15000 , just grab the deal ,,,, dont give a second thought!!!! PS.- i upgraded to KITKAT 4.4.2 the next day i recieved it. :)
Shipped my order very soon and the delivery was also very quick. Happy with the transaction, recommended seller.
Very good tab... Flipkart delivery was great.... Packing was good.... This is my first tab and i beleive this is one of the best tabs... The only drawback is lack of camera.. except that all are very fine...
The Galaxy Nexus 7 Tab is an awesome device in many ways. I got the Google nexus 7 few days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Its features are: * Best for gaming *Preety good screen resolution *Excellent Processor *Latest versions of ANDROID *1 GB DDR3 RAM
Given the obsession with "Apple" the Asus Nexus 7 makes its mark in the Tablet industry. It offers almost everything the iPads do and maybe even more. It is extremely user friendly. It's upgradable to the 4.4 kitkat OS. The battery life is excellent. The sound quality and picture quality is great if you're looking to watch films on it. In the tablet market I rank this as #1. The only reason why I gave it 4/5 and not a full star rating is because it doesn't have a rear camera. It would be nice to have a camera. That would make it a full package.
But while using the Tablet, there is absolutely no reminder that the product is a year old. Absolutely none. The tablet is mind blowing and with some good combination of schemes only cost me 9900 bucks. I don't generally write reviews, but this is a special exception cause the product is amazing. Also, I got some apps for discount on Christmas. NFS Most Wanted runs like a dream and other display requirements from the Tab are amazing.
After a lot of reserach on what to buy . i finally zeroed down on the google nexus tab. it is really nice product except for the fact that there is not back camera available. Overall the performance is very good. At this price the product is extremely good and worth the price.
The delivery was fast and the product I purchased was Nexus 7 2012 32gb . No problems with products and the shipment. I was not at home at the time when product was recieved , I jus knw that it has defect free and as described. I will be reviewing this product soon when I ll use it!
I bought this masterpiece of tabs 10 days back from flipkart.And to note i really appreciate their service which was delivered in 3 days. I had to say this beats galaxy tabs by margin and stands at same height as ipad mini. Its a pure android experience.things i really liked about it. 1.Great batterylife. 2.Ability to run almost 25 apps without lag. 3.Great gaming experience like nothing else 4.Clearest of HD playback for movie buffs.I fell in love with the device for this!! 5.Support by a maturing Google playstore.But here apple beats it handdown. 6.Pricing at 10999 for 32gb when i bought makes it a steal deal. Cons: 1.Gets heated after 2hrs of gaming.(playing Temple run) 2.Cannot play NFS Most wanted. 3.To use Pendrive,need to buy nexus media importer app. 4.Dependency on Wi-fi . But overall go n buy before they stick a out of order caption.It will be a device that u will fall in love with!!! Enjoy comparing this with ur friends who own Galaxy tabs and ipads and show them how they made fool of themselves. Nexus 7-U Rock!!
I am very much satisfied with the WS retail as i m looking forward to do much shopping in ws retail. packing, quality of the product, timely delivery.. every aspect deserves 5* rating
It was easy for me to search the product on Flipkart online and ordered it.Nexus 7 tablet is good tablet presently running in market.The tablet was well packed and received at expected time by Flipkart.
I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Now coming to the product, Since this is a google product. There is no need to wait for updates. As we know updates are really essential in getting the maximum performance of your device. As soon as i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The device is now more smoother than previous jelly bean version. The 4325 mah Battery easily last for a day with a usage of 6hrs+ screen on time Which includes gaming and HD movie playback.
This is a perfect first Tab for my parents - easy to use, lightweight and very handy! they are more than excited and happy in using the Nexus Tab!
Nexus 7.....Only Name is Enough Its pure Google I recieved it within one day of my order thanks to In a day gurantee.Nexus 7 was runnig android 4,2,2 Jellybean out of box but within 2 hrs it has upgraded to Android 4.4.2 Kitkat.
Been using this product for over a month now Had the best android experience so far Best for a typical android user Runs games without lags, Plays movies in HD Sharp screen for reading purposes Great Battery Life It is value for money. Note: Guys if u face problems with the battery (screen flicker, refusing to boot, etc) all u hv to do is open up the back cover (doesnt void warranty!) remove the battery socket and slide it back in. there are tutorials on youtube to do so.
Best in class tablet and got really good offer form flipkart... Happy with both the product and service. I haven't used the tablet much since it is relatively new.. But battery is really excellent watching movies back to back the juice runs at least 6 - 7 hours ease with Wi-Fi on. Picture clarity and sound is good. Playing games in tab is all together a different experience. In simple words Value for Money.... Worth it!...
seems to be flawlessly fast and 32GB is enough space for basic tasks, apps and games.Only downside being the battery which seems to be little under power class .
best tablet at this price point..HD screen and NVIDIA QUAD CORE processor...32 GB...What else do u expect...... ...simply the best u can get.
This is the fourth Google Nexus 7 , I have purchased for my family members ! Hats off to Google nexus & off course Flipkart
I was looking for a tablet with quad core processor and at-least 1 GB ram with a good brand name . I found all of them in Nexus 7 32 gb . Amazing performance (9 / 10 or 10 / 10) ., touch response is very smooth (10 / 10 ) ., Superb screen resolution and color quality ( 10 / 10) . It gives you 32 gb inbuilt memory . so no need to buy extra SD cards . Its lacking inbuilt 3g sim slot or external dongle support .. it was not a problem for me because I have a smart phone can I can easily tether WIFI or create WIFI hotspot from my phone and access internet in my Nexus 7 on the go .So no need to buy different internet plans for both mobile and tablet . Build quality is superb and looks very nice . One thing I would like to mention is the battery life .. its just above average . 5 to 6 hours under heavy usage like watching videos or hd gaming and more than 10 hours of browsing and other usage . Its been 20 days since I am using this tablet and I haven't found any cons . I would recommend every one to buy this tablet with confidence
FlipKart service is the beat for the fastest delivery and genuine product.Its a value for money tablet if you are searching for only tablet purposes.(No Camera / No 3G)

Very nice product and amazing experience and no lag in the videos. Best product if you don't look for Camera and Phone calls. Battery Backup is average(1 day if not used). Takes more time to charge. Movies ( 4-6 hrs), Games (5-6 hrs). I notified WiFi signal strength problems. If you are crazy about Nexus , go for nexus 2013 version. Overall my purpose is for reading, games and movies. I'm satisfied with this product and thanks to Flip kart for Quick delivery!
Pros 1. Value for money is unmatchable, no othe tablet comes close. 2. Performance of quad core processor with 1 GB of RAM is amazing 3. Game rendering is acceptable and do not lags. 4. Speakers are loud and clear 5. The screen is Full HD and very bright 6. Latest updates will be available sooner than any other device. Cons 1. Battery dies with 9 hours of constant usage 2. Wifi antenna is bit weak in reception(one will not notice any difference) 3. Charger cable is very short in length, bedtime videos while charging will be difficult excersie.
Bought the nexus 7 from flipkart. Very quick and prompt delivery by flipkart. Nexus 7 is the best buy you could make if you need to only read books and are not highly into gaming.
Its the best tab you will get in this price range. Loaded with the stock os from Google it has been a delightful experience with its butter smooth touch. The tab is loaded with Android 4.2 but you can upgrade it to 4.3 & then to latest version 4.4 Kitkat. You can compare it with Dell Venue 7 which has better specifications but has performance issues including poor battery life.(Check online reviews) The only downside is that the front camera is not enabled for personal use;You will have to download the camera launcher app from the playstore. Buy this & you won't regret.
All I was looking for, best in class. Display perfect. android perfect with latest kit kat. All there that's required and must have feature of a tablet. one lack could -be no sim slot thus a no calling tab but would be able to accept wifi hotspot internet.
Used it for 2 days and till now the experience is good. Till now the gaming experience is just magnificent will be giving more updates in future.
Good product. Latest pure android experience. Million apps and extremely affordable. Delivered about two days late. But, worth the wait!
Good Things - 1. Stunning display 2. Good storage space (mine one is 32 GB) 3. Good sound (especially while playing apps like guitar which gives feeling of playing actual guitar) 4. Multitasking is great. My kid gives it a hard time opening videos, games, apps and net without closing earlier ones and it still survives with same speed and performance. 5. Upgrades are supported on the device - asked for upgrade to 4.3 jelly bean on device start. After 2 days was again upgraded to Kitkat 4.4.2 (latest kitkat). That was kind of good surprise. Not happy about - 1. Heats up while playing games (candy crush, little commander, epic, Mau mau etc...). 2. The auto rotate (vertical to horizontal and reversal) does not always work especially for videos. 3. There's nothing special in Kitkat OS for tablets, so apart from icons and black background change didn't discover anything special. I was happy with the jelly bean on my tablet. and the kitkat did slowed down the booting process to about 20/25 secs. I was expecting otherwise. Jelly bean was good at 12/15 secs...
Since this is a 2012 model, there is nothing more to add to the already hundreds of reviews on youtube. My 2 cents.. PROS 1.Amazing value for money .Google tab for under 10k for 32GB 2.Good screen for reading and multimedia alike. 3.Portable and light weight. 4.On the air Google Software updates. CONS 1.Battery life is just around 5 hours with multimedia usage. 2.Speakers are located behind the screen.Not a very good design. 3.Camera is just sufficient for Video calls. Chat videos appear grainy under normal room lighting.
what else can you get for 11k? hd display, awesome sound, 32gb space very handy and very useful. thaks to flipkart.
I got one a week back. But it had some issues with the display. When the device is rotated to landscape mode, the top edge of the screen shows some sort of distortions. After the rotation is completed the screen is back to normal.Got the tab replaced today. The new tab I got I thought is free from the distortion problem. Tab was perfectly fine and showed no sort of issues. Then I updated the tab to the latest 4.4.2 version. Now it has started to show the same issues which the previous tab was showing. I dont know whether the 4.4.2 is the culprit. Other N7 buyers pls help me. Pls check you device and see if u are facing the same issue. My email id is : meonline2013@gmail.com Pls send me an email. I shall tell you when exactly this issue is visible along with pictures.
its the best tab in 10 k value for money its run very fast an smooth without any lag cpu is fast gpu gives console level gaming with its 12 core i battery saver core
Build quality 4/5 Processor/Performance 3.5/5 - tegra 3 with 12 core GPU Features 3/5 - no rear camera, no memory card but there is OTG support Value/Price 4/5 - 12k for 32GB space/ casual gaming/ fast OTA updates/multipurpose one gripe is that there is no proximity sensor -so if you use a case that is not specifically designed (magnet present) OVERALL RATING 3.6/5
Great product. Quality is outstanding for the price.Does everything a tablet should. It is pure google - fast and smooth. One can be also be assured of upgrades for the next two years.
got this tablet for 11K. delivery was on time as usual from flipkart. this tablet from google is really value for money. great hardware specifications from google/asus as it plays all heavy games. one of the best benefit of owning a google product is that very first day i used it, it updated itself to most recent version of android ie Kitkat. I'm happy to have it.. thanks..:)
Shipped quickly, in fact the same day. Arrived quite fast, faster than I thought it would. It was nicely packed, and arrived without any defects.
Its an amazing product for an affordable price. Sleek design, handy and fast, super fast. The time i configured the device and enabled wifi, the first thing it got itself updated to KiKat, the latest OS from andriod. Resolution is superb. Speakers are good enough. Battery Life for me on WiFi - 10+ hours Game experience is amazing. Skype Video Calling works fantastic.
An exceptional gaming experience in this price range of under 12k for an amazing 7 inch screen. There is no negative point in Nexus7. It is designed to not to support the SIM cards/ MicroSD cards, so that is surely not a negative point for this tab. Do not go for this tablet, if: -> you want to make phone with the tab. OR . if you are looking for 2g/3g SIM/dongle connectivity, don't go for this one. -> you are looking for a good camera tab and want to take photos and record videos Certainly go for this tab, if: -> looking for a wifi only tab -> play high end games. I've tested the games like Subway surf, temple run, speed racing and the high end games like asphalt and riptide etc runs just flawless on this. -> play HD videos and movies -> very good battery backup Additionally, also make a note when you are deciding to buy your tab that: internal 32GB storage is anytime better than an internal 8GB + 32GB microSD. Internal 32GB is going to be quite faster. I received this 32GB tab from Flipkart in Jan, 2014 and so far it's working superb without any complaint. Enjoy!
I got this for my mom. Its the best thing available in this price range... and i did not regret buying this. Only shortcoming is that it doesn't have expandable memory... but then my mom wouldn't need that.. she just wants to do some internet which is available at home with wifi.. It is a good purchase.. i recommend it.. specially if its a gift for an elederly person.
Just brought this product yesterday.....it's really awesome...got 4.4.2 kitkat update automatically.....it's just lag free.....best budjet tab at about 11k..i highly recommend this product.
awesome tab.. agreed its the older version, but nevertheless its very good.. have no second thoughts about it.. flipkart has managed to sell this at even cheaper rates than what I had brought them for- so do not miss this opportunity!!!!
This is a good Tab, will work for most of the utilities well except high end gaming. If you want a non 3g Tablet primarily for surfing, reading, mails, office etc. it will suffice all the needs. It is only when you are playing heavy games, you feel the lack of RAM.
best performance easy google o.s update..my tab is now with 4.4.2 android....when purchased a few days ago it was 4.2 android..no need to go to service centre for o.s update...con.no back camera and file transfer from laptop to tab creates a little bit problem...
I am using this tablet for a month now. These are very frank views from a person who loves gadgets: Pros good price and quick updates available. features nice 7 inch tablet 1 GB ram does good for daily needs its a good tablet for gifting it to person who doesn't use many apps on the tab the screen is not that good, images are pixelated but hd movies play clearly. the battery lasts for a day now i am just using it as a social networking tablet all my heavy duty apps are used on my other phone overall good tablet to be used for reading purposes and watching hd movies, ITS a no no for games.
very nice tablet . writing the review after one month use. all game running smoothly. no hang and no lag. clear display.720 p video running with MX Player and BS player smoothly. all video format support like MKV, MP4 and others.battery backup is good not better.if heavy used then backup of battery around 7 hours.so it is good for me.camera is also good , not up to the mark. video calling through Skype is good.nice product from asus.Filpkart service is very good, on the second day i got the tablet.
It's very good...included all necessary features for reasonable good prize Looking for updated Only drawback will be the camera part Needs to be reviewed we extensively
Very good service from flipkart. awesome as usual. Product is very good. Pros:- Very good display. Very good processor to play games. Cons:- Battery backup while on wifi is a little less. But for this price, no doubt, it is overall superb. I have used it for last few weeks.
if u are looking to buy the tab other than for calling... its d best one u can find.. with its best features and technology u wont regret with the new version coming in of nexus 7 coming in, it is still d best tab for d budget range..
Fist about FLIPKART. Excellent work guys and thanks for your support. and the product deliveries are always fast. Now bout the tab. It is nice good looking. Fast? Not so much as compared to Nexus 7 2013. Display is good not best but better than ipad mini. the internal storage is awesome to hold all yor data, big games, I played Asphalt Airborne on this but the graphics r not so good and it lags a little bit. So its certain Nexus 7 2012 is not for high end gaming. So its better to buy 2013 version. I know its very costly buy hey you wont need to worry after that for a year at least. Ups: Bright big Screen with good ppi in market Large storage. Good battery Backup. easy to hold in both Hands downs. No camera on back. Useful if you use facebook much, like me. Front cam good for Skype though. Little Heavy. 340 Grams. No headphones are given. But that is not an issue. Storage not upgrade-able. But you wont need that in 32 GB Version. No sim card? But here is a solution>> If you had a Android phone like galaxy S3 you can turn it into a wifi hotspot. So dont waste money on dongle. or if u wanan buy dongle but a wifi dongle instead. Well the product is awesome after all enjoy it for this price tag.
this tablet is all about entertainment. 1. Long Battery Life , even on latest 4.4 KITKAT version it lasts a day. 2. Butter smooth HD IPS touch screen. 3. works efficiently, 15-20 tabs runs in background and still works without any lag. Cons: no local service center.
Wonderful budget tablet....excellent for viewing movies and and reading ebooks apart from access to other apps and games. Since this tablet is in a way Google's in-house product, the software can be updated to its latest version soon after Google's announcement....thus I have been able to update the OS to Android 4.4.2 version....something that is not possible for other android tablets so soon ! With a solid build and great sleek finish it is a pleasure to hold the tablet in hand. The only negative thing that I may mention is that its battery might have been a little more more powerful. However access to the entire Google eco-system through this tablet is an exciting experience and more than makes up for this shortcoming.
It's been more than a month I am using this tablet, loved the product all these days. It's nice set of functions at that rate. Display, functioning speed, I am happy with this.
very much satisfied with this product. i was also allowed to upgrade android to kitkat 4, that was very good with this product.
this tab is just awesome with never disappointing service the nexus offers is too good the processor is fast ,the display is jubilant ,the touch screen is good ,feel like the tab dances on your finger instructions ,you will indulge in using the tab ,i just gifted this to my wife ,hope she likes it ,i am basically a doctor and i am exploiting the tab for reading books and surfing videos don't hesitate to buy a masterpiece :)
Product is good, but FLIPKART Service is extremely poor. Nobody communicates with you - the retailer, the courier or flipkart.
It's an excellent product and the overall buying experience was good too. My only regret is that I bought it a little too soon out of impulse. The product was selling cheaper a week after buying (felt cheated) and also, there's been a new google nexus in the market (2013) which looks far far better.
If you are seeking a high performance tablet in a tight budget, then this is the one for you. There are many reviews of the product on various portals and sites. All I can say is that it is a great product and it would have been awesome if it had a Primary high Resolution Camera as well in addition to the secondary front facing camera.
Value for Money. Faster enough to run what ever APP you throw at the processor. Good battery back up. Crystal clear display, sharper than a Super Amoled LED screen. Very good when reading ebooks.
Awesome as everyone must've already said... Gr8 cheap alternative to the Ipad. I had to get a samsung tab targus cover for this...i wished there were custom coversits own covers available for nexus
I bought this after the price drop on flipkart. I needed a e-book reader and was also considering a kindle paperwhite. But the paperwhite does not seem to have good pdf reflow support. The nexus 7 is great for reading pdfs as well as ebooks and am very happy with it.
Awesome tab.......... Using since 1 month..no problem at all... Was delivered in just 2 days.. Updated to latest android 4.4.2. Very nice and simple user interface. Worth more than the price.... Very happy with this product. Just go for it. :-)
Flipkart delivered tablet 2 days befor scheduled date !! Excellent shipping service! Used tablet for 10 days and it satisfied me a lot !! Pros : 1. Awesome touch!! I got the definition for buttery smooth touch !! 2. Super HD display ! 3.Powerful NVIDIA Quadcore processor and no irritating lags! 4. Its Google Nexus 7 so latest Android version easily available and greatest development avail at XDA developers!! 5. Awesome gaming performance !! TEGRA 3 GPU !! 6. It can be connected with external hard drives! I tested with a 2 TB HDD ! 7. Gives a luxurious look! And it has superb built quality! Cons: 1. Has faded colors but can be corrected easily ! 2. Battery backup is sligtly low. Got 7 to 7.30 hrs but it can give its best for upto 9 hrs 3. Screen lifted slightly up . But it is hard to notice so no problem Overall: The best device one can get at this price and it wil make us to be entertained. Best suited for reading books, playing games, surfing, and also for watching HD movies!! For an Android enthusiast ,its considered as a device sent from the God! :-) I think its running at low stock! So, order and grab it!! I suggest you to make the order through online payment, so that you wil get the tablet within a day!!
very nice product..fully satisfied..value for money..what else is needed?hi resolution games like gta sa asphalt 8 nfs mw run lyk butter...go for it :)
It is an awesome product. I must say about the touch, wow! really superb. I have iPad4, Samsung Grand2 and other touch devices but the feel of touch screen is extremely good in Nexus 7. The only bad thing is the sound is not that much louder. But with headphone along MX Player s/w decoder (200%) volume booster, you can enjoy very good music! Battery is adequate for a day usage (movies, games, browsing & mainly all time YouTube). Have got updated to 4.4.2 (OTA) - its a butter smooth experience with KitKat. All together its a good 7" tablet which is fit in budget. Go for it!
Have been using the product from around one and half month. Never seen the product hanging or getting stuck. Display is really wonderful and smooth. No controversy in calling it a gaming beast. Worth or delivers more than the money you spend on it. Best product in this price range. Please note you read the specs completely prior to purchase. And do not regret purchasing a product without rear camera and Sim or 3G support. If you can overcome these difficulties, this is absolutely the product you are looking for As usual Flipkart does deliver before the promised date.
Got mine 32 GB one day in advance to the time promised. Frankly first time tablet user so cant say much about the product... but enjoying.... any tips please share...yes volume is no issue as we can get to change the volume in settings... will write more soon... right now well the exitement exitement.......So far very good and great value for money... especially for games and movies...go for it if you are not looking for calling facility, camera facility to take photos and videos. So much of space literally all games can easily get in. Thanks to all especially flipkart. P S It would be much better if the delivery boy/girl could give a call at least one hour in advance before arriving....otherwise...no issues....Good day...
I researched around one month to buy tablet for Ebook reading and social networking uses,This is one of the Best Tablet in In Indian Market, i order on New year offer, Nexus 7 32 GB, i prefer 32 GB because i have many video tutorial. Flipkart delivery is not good now days. I received the product on 4th Jan,it was told to deliver on 3rd Jan, and i found that product was damage, it was not working, after few hour I order for replacement , they send on committed time, I received the product on 8th Jan, This one was good, and it has become more than 20 days to use , i m very much happy with this product, and also i checked this Serial number on Asus website, i found that product is 100% Genuine, this is my first product which i brought from Flipkart. Reason to buy this product: 1. This is cheapest tablet in Indian Market with Android Kit Kat 4.4 I updated. 2.Touch is superb 3.Battery back is not good after updating kit kat 4.4 , but i manage to disabled few apps and now battery is good, 4. Web surfing more than 10 hours 5. Video playing 8 hours 6. Game 5 hours Overall this product is better than Galaxy. Cons: 3.5 Headphone jack not working i have to hold then it is working , I don't know what to do with jack. I m giving 4 out of 5 because of headphone jack. if flipkart manage to fix this problem that would be great.
Excellent for reading, browsing and games. Good enough for watching movies. Sound quality is mediocre, even with good headphones. PS. If you are tech-savvy, could get USB 3G dongle to work through OTG cable.
1st of all hats off to Flipkart for thier superfast delivery. 5 star for them. Very good product at this price. pros: 1) Good handy Size 2) 7 inch Gorilla glass screen is good for everything(Gaming,Movies, Web Browsing, Office work etc) 3) Excellent processor! No sign of lag even after using 3 heavy apps at a time. 4) Nvidia Tegra! Name says it all. 5) Google product so run latest version of android before any other brand! 6) Very good battery backup. 7) Good Charger as well. Device took less time to get recharged.!! Cons: 1) No 3g sim support. (But i don care as i use my mobiles hotspot for internet, also i don need to recharge internet pack on two different sim cards :P) 2) No Back camera. 3) No USB OTG i guess. (though hvnt tried it yet) 4) No memory card slot.
SALAAM...... Flipkart is giving Excellent Service, I had ordered it on EID-E-MILAD on 14th Jan n get delivery in Just Two Days Amazing Service, NEXUS7 & AMAZER CASE, With Excellent Packing.., and i bought amazer case with tab n i got discount from flipkart Thanx FLIPKART, After Using it for 12 days, i m giving my opinion, NEXUS7 is the Best tab in market, those who r thinking to buy go for it, its a GAMING TAB, and it never LAG or Hang anywhere, i bought NEXUS7 32gb for 10,999, battery life is excellent but it take too much time to fully charged, camera is also very good but u can't open Camera without downloading APP for Camera, it works with WI-FI only if u does'nt have WI-FI u can't use it. NOTE : I had bought a nice Flip case from market n i put the tab in it, n when i start playing game in ma tab its display was blank, it because of MAGNETS in the cover so Avoid using cover which contains MAGNETS in it.

This was my second nexus 7 purchase. Coming from an Apple user - U can't go wrong with this tablet. Be sure to get the free KitKat update and u are done. This is the best tablet money can buy (within the specific budget of 15k) but I would recommend shelling that extra amount to get the Nexus 7 2013 Edition. Either way this tablet provides all the bells and whistles one can expect from a flagship tablet. Amazing value for money.
I had used a friends nexus 7 before I bought this one. Good performance, 32 GB is a lot of memory, I have installed many all FPS games and it works fabulously, the following games run on this without any lag whatsoever. FPS Games: Dead Trigger 1, Dead Trigger 2, NOVA 3, Modern Combat 4, Enemy Strike, SquadStrike, Blood Zombies HD Other Games: Subway Surfer,Temple Run 2, Angry Birds, Angry Birds Star Wars, Real Racing 3, Deer Hunter 2014, Cut the Rope, Candy Crush Saga, Bejwelled Bitz, Badland, Wordament, Dhoom 3 Cons: Once in a while I get ghost in the machine syndrome, its as if someone is touching a particular part of the screen, this will interfere with the unlocking as well as automatically open a particular app, due to the app icon location, turning it on and off and cleaning the screen gets rid of it, and it occurs randomly sometimes once or twice a week, but I can live with that!
This is the best tablet available in the market to day. Don't wait for the 2013 one because the cost will never go down! All heavy graphics games work like a charm on this amazing device... Also there is 32 GB of all the space you will ever need. Cons: 1- Does not play movies in full screen and subtitles. 2-Does not play many formats like avi , flv , mkv etc But friends all the problems can be solved by downloading MX PLAYER from Google Play . Definately a Must Buy Don't think just go ahead. You won't get such heavy discount in future!!
Well done Flipkart for the best service, product and delivery schedule. Google has brought the best combination of hardware and software for their nexus 7. Being a user of Apple products I can certainly tell you that this product give better performance in speed, touch and overall performance. but it lags behind in Retina display and Apple OS only. Certainly the best combination in this price segment. I appreciate M/s WS retailer also for their best pricing, quality product and safe packing. I recommend this tablet to all. The only problem with this product is that they are not providing any head phone, but it works with all 3.5 mm jack head phones.
i ordered this tab on 24 jan14 on 5pm with one day delievery guarantee and just got it the next day in the morning at 10am,just when i was leaving for college.it was very nicely wrapped and covered.I just loved it at the first sight.It came with android version 4.2.1 but i got the update 4.3 very quickly.I must say this is a very impressive one.This is the lowest price any google product will go. Just buy it,dont go for samsung tabs at all they are pathetic and run on older android version ics(4.0) this tab is also in the list of getting the update 4.4(kitkat) So i would recommend this tab to everyone who have to buy a tab under 15grand
The best Tablet even if u compare with the best class tablet...in the market of any brand.. A quality product at so less price, buy it blindly if u want a handy pc with all the great experience you want to play with it.
Dont think anything...just buy it. Very nice product and great performance in all heavy apps. Delivery is also in very nice packing and mainly originality is inevitable here.
I don't necessarily write a review but this was inevitable. At 10800, this is a steal. 3G is no downside if you have another android phone where you can give it connectivity through hotspot. I mean, you can't anyways use your sim to call in th 3g model so no point putting in 10000 bucks extra. You can install texitng apps and shift your whattsapp on this. And, it is damn fast. for a user using sony xperia, which has a quite good screen quality, this is better. and games are really fast. Butter smooth. Go for it before flipkart runs out of stock. Anf flipkart: 10/10 for you. the delivery time and packing. great !!!!
i tried to contact through email to provide it at my residence in UP City, everytime the replied in a single fashion persons working at helpdesk are like computer having no brain i am ready to pay in advance
I bought this tab after lot of research at 10999 from flipkart Since there are lot of them available in the market. As usual the delivery was within 2 days. My purpose was for pure gaming so i would say the gaming experience is too good.
for this price it is totally worth it. Flipkart delivered it in couple of days. Now buying a otg cable so as to connect my dongle.
Nice Tab with amazing fearures. a must buy tab in such an affordable price. Flipkar service is recommendable.
Its really good. It contains almost all features at less price. Performance is good. Only drawback I can see is It doesn't contain any slot for SIM
This is a awesome product meets all my expectations and worth the price completely. The delivery by flipkart was on time with good packaging.
Truly an amazing experience! Flipkart delivered the product withing 3 days! I will be grateful, as i couldn't contain my excitement! Amazing display.. the sound quality is beyond good.. GREAT for reading books, playing games, browsing.. The camera quality is good as compared to other 1.2mp cams..I would recommend this tab to everyone.. Especially at just 11k, its worth waaaaaayy more then that
Really nice product from Flipkart, the trusted brand for electronics. Got faster delivery. Got upgraded to Kitkat version
Note: My rating is for the product only, not for Flipkart! I bought this product in Oct 2013, when it was listed for 12,999, with a 5% discount on Citibank Credit card. So I bought this for 12,349/- But very soon, within a week Flipkart reduced the price to 11,999/- with further 10% discount for Standard Chartered cards, making the effective price 10,799/-! So within a week I lost 2,200!! Is not this some kind of a joke? Is not this cheating by Flipkart? Thankfully, its an awesome tablet from Google. Look no further, if you're in the market to buy a tablet. The 2012 model is very much cost effective (particularly the 32 GB version, without SIM card). I doubt if Flipkart folks will even publish this review!
Its an awesome tablet I got a good deal we're in I good a 10% cash back by Hdfc credit card. In all I gt an awesome 32gb nexus 2012 fr 10k that's a steal. Regarding tablet it HV a gr8 resolution, speed is good, all games run fine, The only drawback I suppose is speaker which isn't loud enough. In all it WS a gr8 experience.
It is a wonderful product to use.Touch is butter smooth. As of now i don't find any lag during operations of different applications. Battery backup is Ok type.Screen resolution is good.Overall it is a good product to have. Flipkart is also good in delivering as always and the price they offered was really commendable
Bought it from flipkart , got it within 2 days Excellent packaging and mindblowing service from flipkart Talking about the tablet It's blazing fast and has got the latest updates you cant get anywhere except under nexus devices. Excellent Product Good work Google and Asus.
The product is nice and working in good condition and on top of that the service quality of flipkart is very nice. I got the order 1 day before the actual day of delivery...
Pros: - NVIDIA Tegra 3 T30L CPU frequency: 1.2 GHz (up to 1.3 GHz in single-core mode) GPU frequency: 416 MHz RAM: 32-bit single-channel 667 MHz DDR3-1333 (5.34 GB/sec)[26] - Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9 - RAM: 1 GB Cons: - No SD Card support, this means that when you reset the device the entire data is lost unless you back it up. - 7 inches display with 1280 x 800 pixels i.e, only 216 ppi - No primary camera The price will just mask the cons. You can blindly go for this. But if you are still conscious about the performance and afford to spend a few more rupees the latest is the best bet at 20K :P
Compact and Good Graphics Processing Capabilities. Decent Battery Life. I gifted this tab to mom for social networking and usual browsing purposes this Christmas. I personally use an iPad Retina and iPhone 5S. (Apple Fan) ? Soon I realised that this Nexus 7 32GB WIFI is no slouch either. I could play a 2.1GB NFS MOST WANTED and Casual Temple Run OZ (at highest video quality settings) back to back for more than an hour and still have 85% battery left. (Tip for beginners: Game always with lesser brightness and clearing RAM) Almost All Apps/Games on PlayStore run without any lag on this device running Kitkat 4.4.2 and Nova Launcher Enabled to give it more of a Nexus 5 full screen look ? Nexus 7 2013 is a good option too. But if u wanna gift someone any gadget, this should be your 1st option. Super Cheap yet Powerful.
Does exactly what it states to do.... Am happy with the product and the way it works. A file manager application would have been useful.
Good Product in good price. : - Good quality - Affordable price - : - Battery life is very low especially when you watch videos.
I bought this tab mainly to read e-books. However I was surprised to know that almost every graphically-heavy game works on it. FIFA 14, Real racing 3, GT Racing 2 and the likes. Also it was instantly updated to Kitkat on connecting to wifi. The quality of the tab is excellent and feels nice to hold. The speakers are surprisingly good. Rs. 9900 for the 32 GB version (I bought it during an offer)... I think it was a steal. Satisfied with the tablet and the service from Flipkart.
Excellent tab for this price range Got the Latest update 4.4 Awesome display screen A great value for money Extraordinary service from flipkart.....
I spend most of my time with this :) for me it is better than S4 too.. yay I watch movies , play games , HD games , hear songs , study books , do a lot of video chat on skype.. I installed whatsapp and viber too :D GOOGLE NEXUS 7 (2012) rox A great value for money [ one of the best android tab ]
OVER ALL A GOOD TAB...It would have been good if one a rear camera available... delivery time was quick..3days ahead..
Just Awesome.. No problems.. everything seems so perfect(except one thing).. You will not be disappointed(price to value ratio). At this price range (below 10k), there is no better option than this. I found that left bottom corner heats up a bit. About 35 degrees C, after googling most people say that this is normal
This tablet is real value for money, because although it is located in the middle of the price range of the available tablets, it looks and performs close to the high end tablets. Made by Asus with Google's Android Jelly Bean 4.2, it auto-upgraded to version 4.3 a couple of days after purchase. The Nexus fits the hand well, is not heavy, and the display is bright. It is fast enough for most functions. I have downloaded quite a few apps, but Google Play does not yet offer music in India. However, I managed to copy music from my Windows PC, ignoring the error messages that come up.
Nexus 2012 has all the features of a good tablet except that it is missing 3G. when it comes to 7 inches tablet, using it as a phone and also as a tablet will be cumbersome. instead of investing nearing 20k for a 3G tablet, it is better to have this nexus along with an another android phone in the range of around 9k. I have a samsung SDUOS and easily using wifi hotspot on that phone, i can use this tablet anywhere. For recieving calls we use samsung SDUOS and for tablet applications we have nexus. We are also using this as a external monitor for our DSLR using helicon remote and DSLR dashboard. for these applications no other tablet supports so well as nexus. as usual flipkart services were awesome as we got this delivered in just one day. Awesome Product.
i bought this tablet 3 days ago from flipkart....as always extraordinary service from flipkart....now about the tablet.... 1. its a nexus. 2. latest update to android kitkat 4.4 3. 32gb internal 4. really cheap guys dont wait....just buy it if u want the best tablet experience!!!
I will have to agree that if you are looking around for a budget tablet with best specs, the Nexus 7 is a sure shot winner out of the lot. Its touch is far far better than those within this price range available in the market. If you know how to root it (easy guides and tutorials available online) then there's no looking back! The only negative I would say is the no-back camera, but I guess I can live with it coz the others with one are either with useless camera's or too expensive/delicate to hand it to my 4 year old son for whom it is meant to be a birthday gift!
HAI my name is sajin and i purchase a google nexus 32 gb from flipkart the usage of this device is great because iam using apple now when i used this device i like it very much because its speed and smooth touch and whole i like it very well thanks google
The tab from google is really good.there is no lagging.A real value for money.Enjoy the experience.Only one diffculty is need to root when connect USB by Total Commander APP.
Excellent Buy. As good as it gets. Had bought it as anew year gift for my daughters. Delivered instantly. has already got updated to android 4.4.2. Fast and furious sums up the description. Of course 2012 version but with specs and price a dream buy.
I started off browsing Flipkart to buy a decent tablet around 7k for my little one, when I stumbled upon an eye-popping offer on Flipkart- Nexus 7 32gb at 12 thousands! I wasted no time in ordering for the same and here I am, pleased as ever. Having bought this tab is the wisest thing I've done, i mean, Google products require no intro, do they? Most definitely the best tab around and at 12k, not only is it a steal, it is more than worth its salt! Go for it, before the offer runs out!
I bought this tab 1 month back. I must tell that, I am in love with this tab. But the tab does not come with a screen protector and earphones. Except for this there are no other complaints.
I ordered the product on 30th Dec 2013 and it was delivered to me on 3rd of Jan 2014 i.e with in 5 days. After receiving the tablet i have installed a number of application which can be run. Till now i have no problem with these applications and games. Battery life is also good. Overall a good tablet within this price tag.
This tab from google and asus has created a benchmark for other tabs. Awesome processor, perfect for true multitaskung and gaming, no lags, perfect response. Pros Amazing processor Enough ram Good touch response Good storage (32gb) low price Cons No camera (but thats not what tabs are for) Low sunlight legibility Speaker volume slightly on lower side All in all the pros far outweigh the cons and such brilliant tab for Rs11,000 minus cashback, i am happy. :-D
It is really very good.... I am not a tech savy... I actually bought it to my parents they found it very good and easy to use.
Great product, prompt delivery. The Asus Nexus 7 is a beautiful device that provides the very best in touchscreen capabilities.
I Loved it. Really awesome tab.. I ever had.. Cool one.. Huh! Nice Features and many more.. But it sucks my 3G internet more. When i go to play store and browser . my internet charges more... Wow.. But Stunning graphics.. And really nice for . Gaming.. But it was nice if it was support flash 11.1 .. To play games in fb . But all over the tab. Is realy nice one and awesome.. I had. Thx to flipkart that delivered to me in 2days.
I was used to lags in my NXG tablet earlier, but N7 is amazing. Now I realized the importance of 'brand'. Absolute wonder is what I can rate it as. I immediately got an update of v4.4.2 which is not found in other brands. I am only finding the charging point a bit tight to plug into the tablet, rest no complaints at all. Clarity is stunning!! Thanks FK for delivery within 1 day as promised!
I got a nexus 7.It was great but then its screen started to lag so i filed for a replacement. I got it in three days. but i realised that i didn't take a backup of the old one.I called them in less than an hour of the delivery. The delivery man said its not possible for him to return and then i called flipkart services. the recording said"your call will be recorded to better our services'' when the line was transferred to a person she said its not possable and that i wasent the first one to call with the problem many people had called saying this.Even during delivery the if i call the service they just place the order no. on the webpage and tell me its status, something i know. so my question is Why do they even have a "flipkart service" if the do not do us any service I give 8/10 to ASUS and google. Its stupid things like this that took the publics trust from ebay. i am giving it one star as i can't give zero.
Very high performance, zero lags with surfing and Gaming. Butter smooth touch, Awesome display. Battery life is amazing. 2nd day of purchase i used it for 12 hours on wifi and Gaming. Asus and Google had Just made a wonderful product. Thanks to flipkart
I bought this Tab for Rs.10,999 . Flipkart delivered it in 2 days. Only one thing I can say about Google Nexus 7 is that its value for money. Best Tab at this price.
I was looking for a basic media consumption device with casual gaming. My needs being reading a few books, watching movies on the go, and perhaps a little bit of casual gaming. A tablet can only be a media consumption device, a sort of companion to your phone. And this tab does the job excellently. The screen is good enough (its not 1080p like the 2013 model, but the experience of watching movies as well as reading books is very good owing to its 217ppi count.), the processor is decent to run almost all the games available on the play store and its the right size too. For anyone who wants to use their tablet as not more than that i mentioned above, this is a steal. CON: The battery life seems quite low to me, but that could improve once it runs a few cycles of charges. Apart from this, there is no problem at all. As usual, flipkart was exceptional with its service, delivering the product to me one day earlier.
the price at which flip kart delivers is great in all aspect. the tablet is better both touch response and display quality. i can say it is above average tablet, but the price in which flipkart is delivering makes it better.
I bought this awesome tablet few weeks back.I found that its a great tablet after IPad. Really value for money. Pros: Value for money Great performance No lagging Great gaming experience.World's first Quad Core Tablet Easy to use. Awesome Google card and Google Now Display is simple awesome. NFC Support WIFI Direct Cons: Only front facing camera. No 3G Single speaker. Sound is not strong. If you use good headphone then I will be ok. 3.5mm Headphone jack at bottom of the tablet. !!!! This fault has been rectified in Nexus 2nd gen For hardcore gamer 1GB ram not sufficient.Go for Nexus 2nd gen.
Nexus 7 (2012) is the worst purchase I regret my desion. I used 2 of the device and both of them stopped working after 20,40 days repectively.At first when my device broke flipkart was kind enough to replace mine but now as i used it for more than 40 days no replacement now. My actual condition of my tablet is that it was working fine till it worked and then it would not turn on at all. Both had the same issue. Without even rooting my device it got BRICKED. when I contacted ASUS coustomer support the just replied in a single line saying "take your model to the nearest service center". My nearest service center is 1500km away from where I live in. Worst support from ASUS. But a good service from flipkart though to replce my !st defective peice. Please avoid this NEXUS 7 and go with APPLE if you can stretch your budget, the main reason for recommending apple products is you get coustomer service which you might have never experienced in India, if your device stops working you can get a brand new replacement for the entire 1st year of purchace from APPLE( PERSONAL EXPERIENCE).
There is some technical flaw in the product , I am not sure how it could be ignored it takes a lot of time to charge up again if it's battery is fully discharged , I would like to return the product for a replacement or a repair , whichever is possible
If you're looking for a tab without the calling feature, this is the best. You can do your own comparisons but can assure you the quality of the product is excellent. It beats over priced Samsung and others any day. Bought this product at 11,999/- and very satisfied after using it for over a month now. Also Flipkart did a good job with the delivery.
What is the use of such a "STAND ALONE" device that have NO mode of "OFFLINE DATA TRANSFER". DO I have to DOWNLOAD a MOVIE every time I wanna see it ??? And wht if my net connection goes slow for a few days? HOW would I TRANSFER PHOTOS FROM my CAMERA ??? I would have surely bought it if it had Card AND USB access! Dear @Google, are u listening? Apart from this apparent crack, excellent device all together.
I purchased Google Nexus 7 1 month back. It was neatly packaged when got delivered to me. This is a great product which came to me. If you are not looking for back camera this is a cool product. You can tether your phone if you want to access internet.
Buying this tablet I feel I have started loving it. The speed is zippy, display wonderful and this tablet is good to read e-Books too. I would recommend anyone impressed with iPAD to once give Google Nexus 7 a try, I am sure it would prove itself.
The tablet is a steal for this price but there are some issues that people have to be mindful of. First and foremost, you become a tester of google's latest releases since auto system update cannot be turned off. The recent 4.3 and 4.4 updates have caused quite some havoc wrt battery life. It takes quite some analysis and effort to sort these out. The next major issue is that the display calibration is out right pathetic. The colors and gamma are wayy off and have to be manually calibrated. But that requires rooting and not sure how many people are comfortable with doing that like me. Some popular communication apps like wechat/whatsapp outright crash on kitkat and of course getting them to work on a tablet takes some manual effort involving talkplus etc. If you are willing to put up with all this, go ahead and buy it. This is definitely not a tablet for our mom/dad :)
What more can you ask for 11k ? Flipkart gave it on cheapest price. Everything works fine on this tablet; processing, display, features apps, UI etc etc. MUST Buy!
Go for it guys. I bought 32gb google nexus 7 during new year offer. With 10% extra offer for my hdfc card. Very smooth and total steal for 10000rps. Though battery back up is no so gud. Rest all feature is awesome.
I was looking for a 7 inch tablet for long time.I pads are unreasonably costly and Indian Brands lacks proper quality.This was perfect for me. It should be perfect for you too if you want a tablet capable of handling most new games and apps
I bought this product a few weeks ago and am finding it to be an amazing product really. the Google team has put together a really good piece of tech-gadget in the market. Pros: -> The NVIDIA Tegra Processor is amazing and very efficient. -> The tab's 32GB internal memory is a real bonus. ->The display and user-friendly features also make this a really good piece. ->The RAM is also quite supportive. Cons: ->No rear camera. ->No sim/3g support only Wi-Fi
Hi, i purchased this product on 2 January and today it automatically got switched off and is not starting/charging. will return it :(
Pros: Handy, value for money, google brand name. Cons:Internet only accesible through wi-fi, no rear camera
Excellent Service including return service by Flipkart and team. There was an issue with the product and filpkart replaced promptly today i.e., within 48 hours of my return/replacement request. Nexus 7 (2012) is good tab and exploring the options. Hope would be a good companion for my day to day activities.
Best tablet one can get without burning holes in the pocket. It is full with features and working is very smooth. One does not expect anything less from Google.
I received this product on 28th Dec 2013. The flipkart service is awesome but the product quality and performance is so bad. I am facing lot problem with this product mainly charging, display blinking and heating problem. So please new buyer do not choose this product.Its waste of money as well as time. Subbu.
the product is very good in all its functionalities. however a rear camera could have been included as well. i had bought this a s a gift for my parents and didnt really check for a rear camera as a rear camera, i think is generally bundled even with cheap phones. that was a disappointment though my mistake in not checking out the features. the first thing that my dad asked after opening and switching on the product was "does it have a camera" !
My friend bought the 8Gb version a year back for 13k, this is a deal at 12k. Couldn't find a good cover for a decent price though. ebay has a good deal on screen protectors for this device. Upgraded to 4.4.2 in two steps, first to 4.3 and then 4.4.2. Two heavy downloads of about 190mb each.
Fast and speedy tablet. The only concern is battery drain which with normal usage last about 8 hours on full charge.
Good tab at reasonable price. but only concern has been the battery backup. Please suggest me is their any way to replace the battery of it. any concerned vendor......
Amazing tab....a must have for all techies....delivered in a 6days...thts the bad part thts all...rest all was just fine...thnk u flipkart fr the reasonable price
This is really a very good tab. Only issue is, bit of heating on continuous usage for more than half-an-hour. I am not giving five stars for this reason. But, performance wise, its great.
I have used and handled a number of tablets in last couple of years. I can say for sure that Google Nexus is the best of the lot. It is compact with a very good build quality and just perfect features and hardware internals. It is the only tablet with hardly much bloatware hence it works more efficiently and also effectively helps save power guzzling unlike most loaded tablets in the marketplace. Very happy with the price too. Display is excellent and gorilla glass makes a real diff.
Again I will start with Flipkart delivery system. One word "Amazing". My order was delivered just above 24 hrs. I was really amazed by the system and would like Flipkart to keep it up. On the product... As the title says, its from Google and it has to be cheap. It was a steal for me and I picked it up the moment I noticed the price drop. The tablet does not have the quality of Apple but does justice to the price it available for. I use the device only for Games and find it many times stall when playing resource hunger apps or games. Overall, happy with the device though I would have been a happier with an extra GB of RAM (2012 model has 1GB). And being Google, I'm guaranteed to get quick updates and dont have to wait for the ASUS to send out customized updates.
Every penny spent is worth and best value for money...but it is not about money only. I always had apprehension for Android & in fact this my first own product. And first experience is just extraordinary. Flipcart is in all my purchased till date is standout !!! Just wonderful !!!
It was a timely delivery, received on 31 Dec 13, a perfect time to start with this new tab. No defects and a nice packing. Product is as you know it from the reviews. It is good for the price offered. And i was lucky that 1000 was increased after my order was delivered.
The technical specs are available all over the internet for you to see. However, the ethnic value is what that makes this this product worth every paise. It feels good, has no-nonsense design and has everything you need to do what ever it is that you need it to do. A perfection. A beauty. A Beast.
Its been the best buy for me...no issues with the hardware and smooth touch .excellent graphics and a on time perfect delivery from flipcart ...only con is that a good case for it very hard to find
I got my google nexus 7 2012 on 31 jan 2013. This one has got issue with colors. The screen colors look faded, washed out, with little saturation. My intex aqua i5 looks great in comparison. And the headphone also has problems. Nexus 7 is not shipped with headphones,so I had to use my intex headphones. Whether its a compatibility issue or manufacturing problem I am not sure, because sound over headphone is simply pathetic. I was watching a video over my intex aqua i5, with headphone on , the sound was fantastic.The same video on nexus 7 with the same headphone had very poor sound quality. Touch is amazing. Battery lasts for only 4.5 to 5 hour of heavy use. while playing games it lags a little after a while. I had high expectations. Did not meet to expectations. I don't know now whom to complain to. Safdar
100 out of 100 for google nexus just go and get it only from flipcart, i received in just 2 days and working well. will suggest you to go for wifi model
Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet is a nice tablet in the world of tables... Gaming and video calling experience is amazing... Internet browsing is also very good... The most important thing is the android version updating facility...now I am using android version 4.4.2 kitkat... It's superb....
Amazing tablet. Must buy. If you are worried about the performance of this tablet citing its cost , let me tell you that I have been playing some of the biggest and heaviest android games available on market (Asphalt 8 , GT 2 , Fifa 14) on this tablet smoothly . Not even once has this tab crashed. Build quality : good. Screen: the best I have seen for a budget like this. The front camera is decent enough for video calls (via net , there's no sim card slot here). Cons: no back camera (this hasn't bothered me a bit because the back camera on your tablet shouldnt be one of your priorities while you purchase one) its a GOOD PURCHASE , one which you wont regret. Thanks.
Considering its price,it is one of the best tablet you can get now.But there is one draw back for the nexus 7 tablet probably most of us have encountered. The battery wont get chargered some times and the tab remains dead.There is an easy solution for this probably most of you people know and when it gets started its one hell of a beast. And one advise from me is not to go for android 4.4.2 update as it has a lot of bugs as of now for the nexus series.Most impt problem is the battery backup. So keep 4.3 as of now and go for the 4.4.2 update once the fixes are there.
Perfect Tablet for Gaming and looking forward to buy 2013 Model. I wish if it has calling option as well, then it could have captured Indian Market more than Samsung Tablets.
Waited a lot to get this product at cheaper price.. And it was really a worth the wait for this kind of classy product at the cost of 11k.. Although the 2013 version feels better in specs. but right now its too pricey compared to the 2012 version, Flipkart 1 day delivery is also awesome.
Just upgraded the OS the Android Kitkat 4.4.2. Read some of the adverse effects of this upgrade on the net - such as poor wi-fi signal, poor battery life. However, I didn't find any of those problems with my tablet after the upgrade. The UI is smooth and has no lag at all. The app drawer opens up even faster than before. The speaker sound is quite loud. The HD playback has no complaints at all! Overall - feel free and safe to upgrade to Android Kitkat v4.4.2.
Price , features and look is good. My kid is enjoying his new tab.Pretty fast and easy to configure.Delivered in good packing and fast delivery by flipkart.
This product justifies the term 'true value for money', especially at Flipkart price. 32GB @11k is just a steal. First thing anyone would notice about the tab is its fantastic build quality. It feels great to hold the tab in hand and the grip is amazing. Not even once I felt that it would slip from my hand. Upgradation to Kit Kat version is icing on the cake. Have been using the product for about a week now and so far havent experienced any sort of lag. Display is treat for eyes and it comes with decent battery back up. Note that this tab doesnt come with rear camera, it features only front cam. But, it wasnt a deal breaker for me. At the end of day its a fantastic buy which provides a premium feel, pure android at an irrestible price.
AM interested in buying this device. Does this device support 3G using a sim card? I need both wifi and 3G cellular compatibility.
it was really nice to get this nexus 7 2012 edition at such price which i consider value for money with fastest delivered to me.
Excellent product for the price - Did not find any product with this kind of finish and specs at this price range
This is an excellent tablet and meets all the requirements for me except for one...it does not have a Primary Camera. You would expect that in any devise of this segment and hence I didn't check the specifications minutely. Very disappointing but can't do much now. Otherwise excellent product for this price and excellent services by the seller (WS Retail) and FlipKart.
Display blinking/ flickering on lower brightness, returned for the second time lets see what happens for the third device. Just for the record for reference, (as have sen in th post yaar ruk jata to acha hota :P) listed price here on FlipKart dated 30-Dec-2013 is [Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet 32gb - 10,999 INR]. with 10% discount on HDFC credit or debit card that comes around 10,000. not a bad deal at all . bought on this deal only there was no idea in my mind to go for any new tablet as earlier was having nextbook 1ghz tablet with ICS 4.0. Yeah so experience with flipkart was not that delighting, on website i found 10 percent discount on both nexus 7 (2012) 16 gb and 32 gb models called 4 times to flipkart officials and surprising thing is twice they said "sir this discount is available for 16 gb model also with listed price 8999" [[Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet 16gb - 8,999 INR]. and twice they denied.this was really confusing and ambiguous situation i ended up with 32 gb model as wanted to get that 10 percent discount at any cost. but FK you really need some trained staff with sound knowledge of products here on this site and available offers. This is my second purchase with flipkart and no bad experience so far with delivery and quality of product. Price offered is incomparable. hope you grow this way only FK respect! Got defective product first time now waiting for replacement ! screen flickers randomly after some R&D got to know this is due to improper installation of battery cant fix this my self as that will void warranty. Havnt got product yet will edit my review but as obvious great product from google and theres nothing new to expect.. too much excited for this nexus's nexus ;).
I bought this tablet few days ago. Overall experience is good except battery backup.. I have mentioned some pros and cons: pros: 1) Great display quality 2)Supports majority of games without lags 3)Smooth transitions 4)Descent build quality cons: 1)Avg battery backup: If you are into continuous gaming like subway surf,temple run battery will get empty within 5 hours.. If you are into browsing then battery standby will be around 6 hours. 2)No ear phones in the box. Apart from battery life everything is great about this tablet..If you are not an extreme hardcore game lover then this is the the best buy...Even extreme game lover could buy this tab but battery is the small issue..Think and decide yourself
I never expected such a brilliant experience from a device of this price range.. Google's OS and its stringent spec pricing selection are the only keys for the success of this product.
Kindly let me know does it supports 3g data card and whats app?............. n if yes then which data card it wil support..
I got the 32 GB model as this does not support additional storage by means of a MicroSD card. There are enough reviews here that list all the benefits of this device, so I am not going to repeat them here. For this price, this is the best tablet you can find, and you will not regret the purchase one bit. Just remember that this one does not come with a rear camera, and battery life is not the best (not bad either). But then again, look at the price, and do not hesitate.
The best bang for your buck... Brilliant product from ASUS and Google..
Flipkart service is very good, comes to tab fantastic look , with in a minute I got 4.3 update and again 4.4.2 kitkat, performance is very good, Best tab at this price, 32gb is perfect choice for gamers as it doesn't contain memory slot also.. value for money is very small word for this tab
Bought this just as the newer 2013 Nexus 7 was launched at a heavily discounted price of Rs.11,999. Just as I received it, the priced dropped further...but still a great buy. The Nexus is sleek, light and much faster than I anticipated. The screen was a revelation, viewing angles are better than the ipad mini. Texts and colours are sharp and bright. Setting up the system was a piece of cake and took not more than 20 mins and it was good to go! The software was upgraded two days later with the newer version! The build quality is good in that there are no dust collecting gaps etc. The lack of any physical home button is a bit annoying but guess one would get used to the touch soft keys eventually. Only gripe from flipkart is that the head phones are not a part of the buy and you have to buy a screen protector separately as well which would probably be thrown in if I was to buy them from a brick and mortar shop.
The price and specs are really awesome with google live updates is really uncomparable to other brands.. so this tablet is the best for me................................
Amazing product at the price range. It is noway inferior to any samsung tab within 20k. I purchased 32GB edition as there is no option to expand memory.
Already had one, this was my second purchase, you can never go wrong with Nexus. Flipkart delivered the product in good pack, and timely.
One of the best product that I got from flipkart. I have an ipad and in comparison and for the money that I paid , it's really worth . The screen resolution is great and works smoothly when connected to wifi. The only problem is when you double tap it , it's gets struck and has to be shutdown and restarted.
Google Nexus 7 (32 GB) is really an awesome tab, I did lot of comparison before going for it and I finally decided to go for this one and I am happy about my decision. I would recommend this Tab, an fabulous product for this price. Thanks for flipkart for its fast delivery !!!! Regards, Kiran Kumar
nexus 7 2012 is a steal for the price and I got a 32gb one......even better.......the specs are very good and it runs very fast with heavy apps too.......Fantastic.....
Thanks to Google & Flipkart for providing this Awesome Tab at this price . Quality at its best . Real Enjoyment for Android lovers
A nice piece of hardware . This is by far a good tab for 11k [GOSF sale] from flipkart. The tab was uploaded to 4.4.2 Kitkat within 1hour of start up. Quite impressed with the flikart delivery and the price during GOSF sale.
Great job Google. Brilliant device, amazing display. Absolutely love it!!!! I cannot find anything that I did not like. Google ROCKZZZZ
A good product from google. Just love the speed and the screen resolution. Its Compatible and weightless and a real companion for travel even when they dont support 3G.
This tab is worth the money and being a google product, the android versions are updated early. Storage is reduced to close to 26gb due to many reasons and ram usage never crosses 650mb. Overall, runs very fast and smoothly. Already updated to android 4.4.2. No primary cam. Secondary cam runs decently. Skype calls running fine.
The Nexus 7, as is well-known, is a versatile tablet, and esp. at the price at which Flipkart is selling it. my device though had the infamous screen-flicker issue, which could be irksome for those who use their tabs to read at night under low brightness settings on the tab. anyway, got it replaced soon after realised the issue. the customer-service and follow-up was a breeze! got it replaced in no time! however, the 2nd tab too had the same issue, and i requested for another replacement, but Flipkart expressed its inability to do so (took their time to thoroughly enquire about this first, though), and offered me the full refund for the tab as well as the extended warrant-kit that i had purchased. got the refund in a few days, and it was a totally hassle-free experience of mine, with Flipkart's stellar service to back it up! even though the tabs had issue, this was my best experience so far in e-shopping and allied service! other portals should definitely take a cue from Flipkart and follow suite! kudos!
Great tablet for casual internet browsing and media usage. Slightly irritated by the fact that the bluetooth connection to the speakers sttuters when I try to Multi task. Being the first to get android updates often means we have to wait for the Applications to upgrade. Have had few apps refuse to work on a higher android version
I've been using this product for past 2-3 months. Kudos to flipkart for delivering the product perfectly packed within the promised time. This is an excellent product from Asus/Google in this price range. They have offered high end technology in such feasible price. Unboubtedly, no tab in this price range can match the performance of N7. Kindle fire has its limitations related to amazon modified android. ASUS fonepad is a competitor but my friends using fonepad had faced some complaints so I din't go for it. Pros: Its a GOOGLE product. First to get any android update(but Google din't exactly keep up to their promise. Nexus users had a 3-4 week delay in getting the Kitkat update). Excellent performance(The processor is too good and overcomes the "just 1gb ram so it will hang" misconception people have) Plays 720p videos, streams Youtube HD seamlessly. Decent audio. Storage extension possible to even TBs if u but an OTG cable which costs less than 200rs. Can play almost all the games which are available in market now. If you are ready to ROOT the device, then the functionality is way more. I use whatsapp, youtube, proxydroid and almost all the apps that are blocked by my college proxy. Cons: Just decent battery life(don't even think about comparing with iPads, but good enough for a tablet of this performance in this price range). 16GB version slows down by the time you install all the apps and fill your storage, Go for 32GB if possible. I own a 32GB version. No FULL HD support. No 1080p videos wont play properly. In case of non 3g versions no GPRS/3G means no internet unless you have a wifi. Hence useless for browsing and navigation while you are travelling. But all the cons are not exactly cons but are limitations of the product that you know beforehand, so basically I will have to say I din't find anything bad about the tab till now. So im left with no choice but to give it a 5/5.
got this during GOSF offers for 10,999/- ...!! i was stalking this tablet for about two months and finally wen the price dropped to this low, i ordered it rite away..!! no tablet better than this in this price range ...!! even till 18-19K...!! No lag , ultimate display , nice battery life ...!! Good for gaming and watch movies ...!! Overall best in the category of tablets ...!!
I am surprised by the quality of the product and that it never hangs...! This is a tablet I bought after a lot of thought and research (also done in flipkart). I find it extremely convenient to manage all my mails and youtube videos online, using the tab. Google's Nexus receives all updates almost instantaneously and this is ever so true, as I got my Android version 4.12 recently updated to 4.4 This is also a practical equipment, since it allows for longer playback time, thanks to the software upgrade. Must consider buying it.. If you had bought it in the recently concluded GOSF it was available at an awesome price too. Would recommend this to all buyers who are considering a budget priced hi-quality, top of the spec product.
This is by far the best value for money tablet available in the Indian market on date. Pricing is very good on this site compared to competing portals and delivery was speedy as usual. Plus points 1) Immediately updated to latest Kitkat version 2) Display is very sharp and Corning Glass is relatively smudge free. 3) Very light weight and good texture on the back Negatives 1) Lack of rear camera irks when using augmented reality apps and their ilk 2) Choice of covers available for this tablet are very limited here.
Flip kart offered the same tab 32GB/3G for 15K in Diwali sale, the so called biggest online sale that there was in India, bull ! As soon as Diwali was over FlipKart immediately brought the product price down by, wait for it ... 3 K !!! The same thing is available now for 12 K ! Why would you do this to me FlipKart ? Why would you call something the biggest online sale and then sell the same product cheaper as sooon as the sale time is over !!! Plus the product you delivered to me the first time was faulty, it had to be replaced ! And as you can see from other reviews I am not the only one who got the rejected products in the name of Diwali sale. My guess is these guys are most likely fixing the faulty products and selling it for cheaper price, FlipKart atleast have the balls to say this product is refurbished !!! AVOIDDDD
Cool Tablet.... Gaming effect is very good. Little bit heat when play games. but it's ok it happen with almost tablet & mobile. Really worth of investment in Nexus. I am buy in GOSF so my purchase cost is Rs. 10999/- i am so happy........
This is a tablet that's well worth every penny paid for it. It doesn't disappoint one bit, and excels in delivering what the specifications and description promise. I received it in a day's time and the delivery was made within the time promised. I'm yet to hear of reviewers complaining of Flipkart's delivery service, so whoever is in-charge of logistics is doing a bang-up job. As for the tablet, I'm sure the positives other reviewers listed are quite true and accurate. So, I'll just mention the good things I found pleasing with the Nexus 7. Firstly, the device fits snugly into ones hand and does not threaten a fall. The design is spot-on and is made to please. The product arrived with JellyBean version 4.2.1. As soon as the initial registration process was through, it prompted an update to JellyBean 4.3. Soon after I landed with the updated version, the next prompt (to my surprise) came up. The tablet now runs 4.4.2 (KitKat). The response is very smooth, does not lag and with intermittent use, ran for 2 days and 16 hours before the battery-low warning showed at 14%. Now, for the negatives: The tablet does not have a rear-camera. Unlike the 2013 version, this one feels incomplete without the rear camera. I honestly don't use the camera much, but it'd have been a terrific product had it had one. The screen size could've been a tad bit bigger and would make viewing movies/video clips a lot more fun on a larger screen. The stock apps that come bundled could do with a face lift. It's true that we can download them off the Android market, but adding the right set of apps along would've made the experience a lot sweeter. Now, these are my personal opinions and are the things I'd have considered if I was in charge of designing the product. For the price it retails at, it's a great deal and a fun gadget to own!
I would definitely not say this is the best tablet out there. But, given the price bracket in which it falls, it certainly is a great buy. Bought this for my dad who had no experience of using touch interface and he is having a great time on it. Kudos to Google
I comepared with all contempory devices find out best to buy ..100% Value for money..Amazing device superb performance.. Best feature :Display and 100% Androide Device its automaticaly upgrade to 4.4.2 kitket .. you can also try kindle Fire HDX but its not 100% androide ..
I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was Superb, i got the tab within 2 days. i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The Battery usage more than 6hrs very good. The Screen & graphics are very good (HD, I love them). This is the gaming tablet. Excellent Tab
Overall its a very nice product,it feels nice to use it. Battery is fantastic, Sound is great. But i really miss the rear camera and feel helpless because it has only wifi, i could have waited a little more and rather bought the new Nexus Tablet by Google. But its nice, it does its job really well of keeping me entertained.
Nexus 7 by Google is truly value for money. Slight heating issue and a below average camera but all the games run so nicely. As the product is by Google, Android updates are applied first.
My experience with the Nexus 7 was too good. I got it at the reduced price probably because the 2nd Generation Nexus 7 was about to be launched, but honestly love the device and the performance I get. Feels really good in the hand and no lag while using it. Only reason it lost the last star was cause the Kit Kat upgrade wasn't on par with the one bundled in Nexus 5. Els all in all a great device.
Researched a lot and got two of them (One for a nephew). It's really fast and smooth. Delivers what all the specifications tell you. Including NFC - tested it and it's fun. No starting problems like the ones specified. Other than the following drawbacks I face, I am hooked on to my Nexux. I'll get into the cons and workarounds for it: 1. I could not install Whatsapp and Angry Birds Go from Play store - says "This is not compatible with your tablet." Did the workaround and it works like a charm on the tab now. Workaround: a. I downloaded the apps on my Xperia U. b. Installed an app extractor and saved the apk. c. Transferred it to the tab using USB / WiFi transfer. d. Installed it on the tab. 2. It heats up a bit after playing for 2 - 3 hours. 3. Takes time to charge. (Compared to my mobile phone) 4. The USB charging cable is too short. 5. Screen is a finger print magnet.
Owned it for 2 months now, no problems to report what so ever. Works as promised. Latest updates are just too easy to download. Multitasking is a breeze. The biggest downside wold be the lack of a camera. The new Nexus 7 has been equipped with a good camera but not in this price range.
i have a nexus 4 and a nexus 7 now both are awesome both of them are best in thier own field i short listed 4 tabletes which were samsung galazy tab 3 asus fonepad nexus 7 lenovo idea pad but tab 3 was not so good asus fonepad is the worst tablet in this list and seceond last is leneovo idia pad
I only say it's "Awesome Tablet"....B'coz it's performance is Awesome, Buttery backup is Awesome, Gaming is Awesome......Internet speed is also Awesome.... I Love this One..
I don't have a SINGLE complaint. This is truly an awesome product for the price that it is being offered for. Played lots of 1080p movies effortlessly and I was also able to play heavy games like Dead Trigger 2 without any lag at all.
After purchasing this, I stopped using my PC for my regular use at home. With a wi-fi connection, I could do almost everything in my Nexus 7 itself. I'm completely satisfied with Nexus 7 except the fact that you can not exchange data from/to other storage devices using OTG cable without rooting the device. Looks like there is an app using which we can copy data from other devices to Nexus 7 but not vice-verse. Overall I'm very much satisfied with this product.
Great tablet , very light and convenient to hold in hand , the speed is blazing fast. Ideal for gaming , watching videos and as eBook reader.I also use an iPad with retina display , so compared to that , display is a bit inferior but mind you , it is certainly not bad for the price especially videos look fantastic. Using this more than the iPad these days. The packaging was great and fantastic service as always by flipkart, received the product in less than 36 hours after placing the order. Only sad part is bought it for Rs11999 just a week ago and surprised to see the new price tag 10999 :( .Flipkart , can I get a refund of Rs 1000 please... Grab it before the stocks last.
Design failure. Please dont buy looking at the configuration. I bought last month, just after a week I am facing charging problem. If you dont trust me, then please search for Nexus charging problem in google and decide yourself.
Couple of months back I purchased Nexus 7, 32GB wifi modal from Flipkart. As usual the flipkart service was delightful.. The tablet gives a great quality experience for the user, no doubt about it. Accidentally the tablet screen developed a crack which hampered the touch operation but the display worked fine. Called the Asus service center for the touch screen repair and replacement. They quoted Rs.10000/- for the tablet display screen replacement and said the rate is fixed by Asus. As an alternate they even suggested me to buy a new one which would be same price as the replacement cost. It was a real disappointment to hear that from Asus. So my verdict is Nexus 7 is a good tablet for this price range until its not damaged. So handle with care.
Nexus 7 2012 is one of the best tablet available in the market at this price range. On the first day it got updated to 4.3 and on next to 4.4. Performance is awesome. Battery life is good. Playing Games like Asphalt 8, GT Racing, NFS MW, Mortal Combat 4 is butter smooth. In all a Superb Tablet at Superb Price.
The nexus 7 is very small beast ,but if you are used to a big tablet such as the iPad you may find it very small. Overall ,the nexus 7 is the best available tablet for its price. Being a nexus device , it will always get the android updates first. I would recommend this tablet to the people looking for a tablet in this price range.
This product from Google is just great. It may be a little old due to the new introduction of newer products. however, for general use, this product leaves many other similar tabs far behind. At @ Rs. 12,000, Value for money. This, backed up by a efficient and quick delivery by Flipkart ensures a pleasant buying experience.
Hi Guys , Recently i brought this tablet thru flikart . Overall all product health is very good . How ever i found battery backup showing is around 4 hrs . I am not sure , what should be approx backup hrs should be . Can anyone pls help to answer .Note - i am not running any application and battery backup showing 4 hrs around .
Grab it before stocks last. You can't get a 16-core tablet (4-core CPU + 12-core GPU) cheaper than here. Plus, its a Nexus device.. so, you'll get Android updates pushed directly from Google as soon as its available. I got the Android 4.4 KitKat the first day.. :) Its 1 week already since I received the tablet. This week was very rough for it because of initial setup ju-ju... And, it has passed the test. I never experienced a bit of lag even after heavy use & battery backup was great so far. Its Wi-Fi is quicker than that of my Laptop. And, it can play anything at its arsenal.. I am playing Ripetide GP 2 at this time. Don't ignore this just because it doesn't have 3G. Just purchase Huawei Wingle E8131 Data Card for Rs. 2500. Its as big as other 3G dongles but it can give portable Wi-Fi access to your Nexus 7. You just need to give it power with wall socket (no need of PC, drivers etc.) which can also be done with OTG cable attached with Nexus 7.
Well If You Are Thinking Of Buying A Tablet This Is The One. The Price Has Come Down And It Is Pure Android Experience. I Got The Tablet Updated To Android 4.4 And It Work Wonders. I Am Using It For The Past Two Months And It Has Never Let Me Down For Even A Second. Go For It If You Are Looking For Something Different Than Samsung And Apple. The Build Quality And Looks Are Excellent. Just Lacks Rear Camera But Everything Else Is Just Top Notch.
I purchased this through Flipkart 1 month ago for 9499 & honestly man Best decision of my life. This tab is hell lotta fast & better in every aspect. All high end games like- NFS Most wanted, Asphalt 7,8, Modern Combat 3,4, Shadowgun, Amazing Spiderman, Batman runs buttery smooth n while playing games you get over 600mb FREE RAM so performance is just WOW. 2 weeks back KITKAT update as well. Remember this will be updated to 4.2 & Bluetooth wont work. But just update it to latest 4.4 version & it will work. (mine worked with 4.3 update). NO CONS in this product. If you want a TAB just for Gaming ,this is it. Only thing is this TAB wont let you do anything for 1st time unless you connect to Wifi. Buying this tab is like Heaven than purchasing CHEAP SHAMEsung or Micromax phones. 16gb was enough for me.so far i have Asphalt7,8, MC 3,4, NFS Mostwanted, Riptide gp2, Amazing spiderman, Batman, Shadowgun installed. Battery life is also amazing. Non stop gaming for 7-8 hours. Medium use will last for 2 days.
The tab overall features and responsiveness lived up to its expectations. Been wanting to buy one for quite some time now. At 12k, this deal was a steal. I should've given a 5-star rating if the rear camera were also there. Guess I didn't read the specs correctly before ordering, MY bad.
Excellent build and picture quality, easy to use, for this good price. Once connected to wifi, I was easily able to upgrade this device's OS from 4.1 Jelly bean to 4.4 kitkat can be multi used except phone functionality. I'm amazed with it's GPS functionality, you can easily locate you location in real time without wifi. Best campanion while travelling or can be used as car entertainment with GPS and OBD 2 functionality
Only 1 Minus Point Not Back Camera otherwise speed is to good and very smoothly working display was to good
I love the Nexus 7 Tablet that I purchased from Flipkart and I wish they had the latest version available.
This is the best available option for the best price I was worried reading faulty pieces reviews But mine is just awesome :-) No problem regarding the tablet If you are thinking to buy the tab then go for it blindly and trust me you will never regret Enjoying 4.4 kitkat in its purest form :-) Kudos flipkart
i just recieved my nexus 7, and wholla its jus awesome!! the screen unlike i saw in videos or reviews was simply superb. if you are planning to buy one,then just go for it,u will never regret. device is snappy,but max volume itself is low(never matters anyways). fluid in performance backed with great screen quality..worthy investment!!
Before using this tablet I was a user of Samsung galaxy tab 2 P3100. Since the release of this device wanted a unit to use by myself,now the time has come and I'm using this from last saturday. In compare with Tab 2 it's very fast. Currently running 4.3 and hoping it'll get 4.4 update real soon.
I've been using the tablet since yesterday and i m just loving it ... no lag or hang up when playing games ... initially i took some time to update the device ... now running 4.4 android ... so far nothing wrong and using everything possible to find a glitch ... nothing as of now ... so i would say much better tablet compared to samsung or any other in the pricing range ... go for it without thinking much ....
I hv ordered it by debit card on 28 Nov and tablet is delivered on 30th.Packaging was good bt not great.I ws little scared by reading reviews of getting defective product.I received a good product and tablet is working fine and updated to KitKat 4.4.Nexus 7 is very good vfm product nd hardware performance is excellent.Gaming and browsing experiences are also great.Sound quality and eBook reading experiences are also fine.Only thing little annoying me are touchwiz interface and customization as I am a Samsung S3 user.Keeping finger crossed and wishing tablet will b working fine...
It is really a great product to own..:) Its one month now and I'am enjoying it...It will become your best buddy for sure:))
Its very nice tab 32 Gb... Nice Speed Nice Display Not it got 4.4 Update also ... and flipcart given very fast delivery with in 24 hours i got my tab.
One of the best available in market for the price. Even my friends with apple ipad are envious..... Screen resolution is nice. Sound quality is well enough. Good processing power and graphics card. can play all games including fifa 14.....

With in the specified price bracket, this device is worth of purchasing. I have noticed: 1. Display clarity is very clear 2. Good and nice video playback 3. Good battery backup 4. Faster and real graphics content 5. Feels really good while reading the ebook contents 6. Very handful tab/Personal device 7. Quick availability of the Android updates as it is a pure Google product The device sometime gets heated up when kept on a Plane surface while charging. Its good to charge 100% of the batter while the device is switched off. It increases the battery lifetime. Feeling very satisfied with the device performance.
Had a great experience while using Google Nexus 7 tab.. if you dont require back camera then this tab is best. and i personally feel that paying 11k just for 5 megapixel camera is not a good deal with comparison to Google Nexus 7 (2nd gen)
I have a Google Nexus 7 16 GB bought from Flipkart for Rs. 9K. No doubt the pircing is excellent, display is GREAT, NO LAG, SUPERB for GAMING. But let me BEWARE you before you buy it. Very Poor Wifi Signal. Even poor than any other 5 mobile phones at my home. Gets disconnected very often and unable to catch signal in less than 10 mtrs.. while my mobile phone and laptop wifi shows good signal even at 20 mtrs distance. Still I will rate it 4 star because the product is excellent. I cannot work with this in my Balcony (where I love to sit and browse internet the most) but its all right.. this is as good as any other Rs. 25K Smart phone without a camera and Sim Slot.

man... man...man...this is damn cool... i mean from the moment i bought this... i am only on it.. the quad core processor is a perfect companion of the 1 GB of ram... this is the best tablet... this is specially for gaming... you will never regret about this choice... i have 50 apps and games installed.. but the best part is that it doesn't slow down.. kudos to asus and ya to google...!!!
coming to the tablet it is an awesome buy. This has a perfect form factor and the perfect size. Love playing with it. now coming to the performance the tegra 3 is sizzling and the 12 core gpu is enough for any game on the play store. the display is gorgeous not as good as the new nexus 7 but it is okay as it is a backlit led ips panel. and the sound quality is great actually, i read that it was not great through earphones but if you use good quality earphones(i personally use creative ep-630) and good bitrate audio and video files you'll get good output through headphones all in all a steal at 12,000 rs go buy it!!!
my grandson playing this product very interesting and also learning many rhymes and other primary things thanks to GOOGLE NEXUS 7
Many Thanks to Flipkart Team. As always, Best delivery from Flipkart. It got delivered within 2 days with excellent packing from Seller. Tablet was having some touch screen issues from very beginning. I mailed flipkart about this issue and had a word with them over call, they understood tablet issue right away and shipped replacement table within an hour. Now I got my tablet replaced and it is working flawlessly right now. Great after sales support from Flipkart. No one can match or even come closer to the service of Flipkart. Now coming to the product, it is best available tablet right now in the market. Don't even think about other brands if you want to purchase a tab. Simply go for Nexus 7. Total value for money.
I always wanted to get the nexus phone or tablet. As soon as flipkart dropped the price of this tablet.I snatched it. Got it for 13,000 ...just a week or so before it became 12,000 during diwali sale. With the nexus you never have to worry about the quality. Great specs. Nexus 2013 isn't available in India yet...and paying 10,000 more just for a camera and a slightly better processor doesn't make sense. Go for it till its in stock !!!
Believe me I'm a nexus fan... and I wanted to buy that from a very reliable dealer... I can't find it nearby so I have to search online.... and being a flipkart user how could I go somewhere else... First of all packing is absolutely good... and the product is awesome! the best tablet in market in this price bracket... bought it for 12500 from flipkart a week before Diwali.... it works like charm... looks wise its absolutely amazing.... I remember when I was searching for his case a sop keeper asked me which tab is this....ipad??? it looks that great in hand! performance very good without any lag.... played fifa 14, real football 12, dead trigger,subway surfer,real racing 3, fast and furious 6, FL commando, Contract killer all works like charm... and apps don't crash at all even after having 80 apps (a bunch of photo editing and social networking)... I got the 32gb variant and I am extremely happy to use my first Nexus and my very first tab... :) I'm loving it... thank you flipkart!
do not buy this tablet if u want more just wait for the second genration of nexus 7 which is far more better with android 4.3 and can go 4.4 easily far of gr8 tab!
One of the amazing tablets for the money. You wont require any other tablet. Amazing battery life and you cant live without it.
Have been using over a month, its a very good tablet the cons i found is low saturation of the display, everything else is awesome
the best tablet ever for gaming the only only bad effect is that no back camera and no attachment of sim to it.
It Is A Great Tab..!!! I Always Love To Play on It. But It Had Some Cons - 1. When I Charged It It Become Heat Up Very Fast. 2. Camera Is Very Bad ( Becaz It,s 1.2 MP ) 3. Hd Movies Are Lagging ( Not After Install HD Movie Player ) { Sry 4 My English -_- } But IF U R Planing 2 But Galaxy Tab 3 T311 Then U R In Wrong Side I Had Allredy T311 But I Dont Y I Like Nexus 7 32 Gb Becaz OF its Hardware & Software Also ( Android 4.3 & 4.4 Is Comming Soon In This Year ) Thankyou.
The best 7 inch tablet in the Indian market currently. And I'm just delighted with flipkart's service. I got the tab in a day. Way to go flipkart! You are setting a benchmark!
very nice touch response.runs most apps at ease.it's a WOW product.brilliant luks.nice to hold and use. it has very good sound and a bright screen too
i purchased this tablet few days back from flipkart only, and its working great, no issues, better thn samsung tab3.
This is a good tablet around Rs 10000-12000.Display is very good,Ram and processor are adequate enough to play high end games and do multitasking.Battery lasts for 5 to 6 hours on complete charge.Though it doesn't support SIM, it's a good buy if you don't travel much and can manage with WiFi. As it's stock android there is no lag at all. 32 gb (we get around 27 gb for usage) will be handy as it doesn't support external Sd card. Nexus always gets the latest updates as soon as they launch. Great build quality, Comfortable to hold and do the tasks. This tablet has Nvidia tegra 3 under the hood, so we observe heating issue on the backside while playing games and performing some tasks. Visibility and Readability are good.We can watch videos with great quality and reading ebooks are crisp and clear. Screen is gorilla glass 1 protected, but attracts finger prints. may or may not use screen guard, it's a personal choice The sound is comparatively low, but that will not be a huge concern. Over all no major flaws, decent buy VFM for the price. It supports OTG with some tweaks. Regarding updates, Google supports every device for minimum of 18 months.If it's the case including 4.4 kitKat update it also gets 5.0 update for sure. Tailpiece:Though it's specifications are very much inferior to Nexus 7 (2013) version. At the price of around Rs 10000 this is a best buy no complain tablet.
Value for money product at special price of Flipkart with 15% cash back. Product is great at this price. Good touch, very responsive, good speed, already downloaded more than 70 app but still no leg. however new Nexus 7 is available in market but will cost 5K more but in this price range its best.
Awesome tablet and got at an amazing price at flipkart and as usual great service by flipkart. Instead of buying the Samsung Tabs, I would suggest users to go for this tab, excellent build quality and also you would get the latest updates directly from Google.
Best Tablet in the market..!!! At this price, you cannot get anything better than this. JUST GO for it :)
Faulty Nexus 7 (32) gb ---------------------------------- Just within a couple of days of arriving the tablet, it started giving me nightmares n sleepless nights with ton load of problems like flickering, lagging n all.. Sometimes it took me ages just to turn it on as it used to go into deep sleep. So I updated it to 4.3 jellybean in a hope that all problem would be resolved.. To my expectations, it worked very smoothly for few hours and I would be like relieved as well as so satisfied at the same time but just after few more hours it just went into a deep static mode where the tablet doen't turn on.. Now the scenario is -- No matter what you do but it won't turn on.. I noe flipkart will replace my tablet as per their 30 days policy but to be very frank: It's a series of horrifying nightmares to loose your personal data, photographs and all the apps as well as all your efforts, time and money you put in to secure, configure and customize your tablet. Being a loyal customer I feel sorry to say this but lately, Flipkart's Quality Control is getting worse n worse. The tablet was the third faulty product I received. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First time --- WD 500gb HDD : I got it replaced from Western Digital company but it took me like billion centuries and buttlaod of efforts before the actual replacement. Second time --- a Transcend pendrive was defective. Flipkart got it replaced twice. But the same replaced pendrive was again faulty again and i end up getting Flipkart Credit for the same amount. Third time --- The Nexus 7 i recently bought is faulty. However I tried everything under the sun (including instructions given in Google Support Videos) to make my tablet work as I never wished to loose my personal data, photographs and apps. But unfortunately nothing worked... :( Dear Flipkart, please improve your quality check before dispatching the products as No MATTER HOW LOW YOUR price would be or HOW FAST YOU can deliver but a Customer Expects a proper Product in Working Condition n not a FAULTY One.. Thank you.
First of all thanks for Flipkart for giving such an awesome tab only for 12k and plus delivering it in 2 days time. Coming back to pros and cons of the nexus 7: Pros: 1. Solid build quality - gives a premium feels 2. More than decent battery life. 3. 32 gb of internal memory. 4. Lag free performance. 5. Good for mid-range gaming experience. 6. can run pretty much any application available on play store. 7. Good internet surfing experience. 8. Can play HD video with ease - awesome viewing angles - movie watching is a delight 9. light weight - can easily carry it. 10. Quality of charger and USB cable is premium 11. Keyboard is awesome - large enough for easy typing and plus the swipe feature is handy. 12. OTG feature is also great to have - need to buy the OTG cable separately. Cons: 1. Display quality can be more sharp - Even HD wallpapers look bid dull. 2. speakers are not loud - you need in ear head phone to enjoy music and video. 3. no back camera - even the front camera is not that great. 4. Screen is a finger print magnet - but not a big issue for me personally. 5. No calling facility. 6. No memory card - but you need one 32 gb is enough for daily use and plus you can connect external storage through OTG. Over all it is the best tablet if you are ready to ignore the No calling facility tag and back camera. Real value for money. its better to go shell out the additional 3k for the 32 gb version as there is no memory card support. Go for it guys - its a steal deal!!! I have been enjoying the tablet from 2 months now. Complete Lag free performance.
Best in class .. No voice call facility.. Just go for it. i had used it and find n prob till now .. Display, speed and all things are good battery backup is also good .
its a cool product.. i bougth it for 12349 as special discount offer.... im enjoying it... display quality and battery backup is amazingly awesome...
I am not happy about Nexus 7 while using this product with in 2 min heat is generating and not able to handle. I had received this product from Flip kart they had delivery in 4 days . when i opened the box packing is not good . Coming to application wise its not user friendly and Nexus 7 have the seconday camera( Front side ) it is not useful to any one .I am sincerely advising to all don't go to nexus 7 Tab.
A Big applause to ASUS to provide a Quality tablet that is at par with IPAD 3rd gen for this price. Further with the flipcart discount of 31% and 10% cash back, it was a No brainer to purchase this . A brilliant screen and luxurious feel with a tension free gorilla glass display with IPS Excellent for reading books on the inbuilt PDF viewer. Specially when switched to reading view, where one does not have to zoom and keep moving the page from left to write. A well designed tablet , where cost cutting is don't at the right places when the feature is not needed much. Example no back camera (front is there for video calling), no vibration and no light but Who needs all this when u have a good camera phone. BUT 1 PROBLEM I CAN'T TRANSFER FILES OVER ANDROID BEAM (wifi DIRECT) TO MY NOTE 2 or as of such no other samsung phones like TAB or S3 due to the incompatibility of the android 4.3. It just pairs but does not transfer. 3rd party apps dont help either. A big Let down and i hope Google comes out with a patch soon. However its a great Tablet ! and u would not need a 3G version if you know how to create a hotspot on your phone. Oh yes ! ! This has a very imp GPS sensor thats great when using Sygic or any other navigation system that does not need the internet to run.
Great product at a great price. Good clarity, light weight, good battery back up. Hard to find a good case for this though.
I bought the mighty Google nexus 7 last Saturday from flipkart at a really nice price of 11999/- and will be getting a 1800 rupees Cash back by 30 November. I think that's the cheapest i could have paid for this beast. Got the tab delivered on Tuesday and it has been a really nice experience so far. Pros : 1. Its beautiful, smart and with its rubberized rear, its really easy and smooth to hold. 2. No lag: When i say no lag, i mean it. I have been playing FIFA'14 on this ever since i got this in my hands. And it runs multiple applications together without a lag. 3.Updated Android : As soon as i got this, the system recognized there's an update since i see that the build is around march'2013. My tab now runs on Android 4.3 and is lightening fast. 4. Touch : I have used samsung's tab 2 and the google nexus 7 is like light years ahead of Samsung when it comes to touch. Its a different experience altogether. 5. Display : It has a 7" screen. I have played many Full HD videos and movies and they all run fast. Its a treat to watch them on the tab Cons : Many people would argue that the tab doesn't have a rear camera and that it has no calling facility and no expandable memory. My answer would be: Don't buy a tablet if you want all that. Buy a cellphone,rather :) Overall, a really nice buy! Pretty happy with my decision.
I had used Nexus 7 wifi earlier and now with this 3G Nexus 7 is awesome. Too fast and user friendly Tab. Thanks Flipkart for bringing such good deal on this product.
Flipkart - Your business is really professional. The site is very well designed. Good offers. Gifted "Google Nexus 7 32 GB" to my niece for her 3rd birthday :) She is happy. Looks like its working fine without any issues so far. Hope it stays like that forever until she kicks it. My sister told me that the gift packaging was good and it just went with my wordings, had a nice feel. Was delayed by a day (4 days -> 5 days) to Chennai. Luckily I had ordered a week before her birthday. I feel 16GB is value for money and worth buying but I bought 32GB as I can download some animation movies/cartoons for her to save it to the tab and hence more space. Considered Samsung 7" tab but it wasn't worth that price honestly. Samsung needs to learn a lesson or two. IPAD mini is already launched with Retina display. Lets wait and watch the price. Anyways, it will sell like crazy with their fans queuing for a day :p Nexus price will further come down. Is the new version in already? Flipkart, keep up the good work. I will definitely consider buying stuffs from here. This is my first online purchase on a online shopping portal :)
Fantastic product for the current price. Product Quality of Google coupled with the ever awesome Flipkart service was fantastic. Got my tablet within 48 hrs. Though the new generation Nexus 7 might soon get launched, it is sure to be priced close to 20k. So, no concerns regarding the purchase of older generation Nexus 7. Go for it. You won't regret. !!!
First I would like to write about the product. Guys if your budget is around 10 k for a tablet go for it. U won't get any better tablet than this. If ur wallet permits pay another 10 k for nexus 7 2013. Pros. 1.great HD screen. 2. No lags even playing high HD games like modern combat 4. 3.we can connect pendrive or harddisk through an app called nexus media importer.so problem of not having SD card slot solved. 4. Super touch experience. Con's. 1. Its a fingerprint magnet. Don't compare it with Samsung tab 2 or 3 its far better than these tabs. Not to forget great pricing from flipkart and it reached within 48 hours from my ordered time.totally superb..
Awesome experience.. Display is very good (LCD HD) Touch Sensitivity is very good Great experience when doing gaming, no lagging.
[+]: >The quality and stability of the software along with the buttery smooth UI are just unbelievable, it's pure Google beauty that you get to enjoy only with a nexus after all ! >The price truly makes it a steal over here, Google's subsidy makes it ultra-competitive, virtually there's no tablet which gives this good value for money. >Screen Size: I used an iPad 2 prior to this and believe me the handy 7 inch size and lesser weight is a relief ! [-]: >If you're coming from a high resolution display phone/tablet you might find it a little bit of a strain. >No headphones (i.e. if you're looking forward to them, else it's fine) --Disclosure: I'm not an avid gamer, so I can't say about the gaming performance, although I did try subway surfer and it worked flawlessly, but can't comment on high end games. Ordered this during the flat Rs.1000 off period along with 15% cashback, sweetest deal from flipkart ! Service was great as usual, delivered in exactly 60 hours from time of placing order.
I was surprised when i received the order at my home. I placed an order on 20th 12:05am, and i had the tablet at my doorstep at 21st 11:30am. (even though 20th was sunday) The packing was really the best i have ever seen with very good care taken to the packaging to make sure no damage was made. So 5/5 to Flipkart for making it possible, also it was a awesome great diwali deal, couldn't resist the price offer, and i bought it. ---- Now regarding the product, i did a lot of research before buying the product, i know that this is the 1st gen, and the 2nd gen is already released and a lot better in terms of memory, processor, camera, and other aspects, but seeing this great deal with about 41% discount, i bought it no-matter what. You cant get anything better for the 12K price, no other tablet matches this. lus you get vanilla android with the latest updates instantly. I started my tablet, and within few minutes the 4.3 android was available for me to install. And im sure this table will also be getting the KitKat version too as soon as its released. Great Product. Cannot complain anything about it.
Touch is smooth. . Performance is very good espesically during games like Temple Run. No hanging problem since i received. Overall a good product.
Nexus 7 osam I like the most is the display any angel you can view it .. Processor speed amazing EA football 2014 works osam in it.
Received the Nexus 7 in a well packed manner. The Only hiccup was the it would not Turn ON immediately as the battery had no juice at all. I had charged for about an hour after which it turned on. For a 7 inch tablet for this price you would never get a better one.
Got it from flipkart for 12.35 K two weeks back... the tablet is absolutely brilliant for gaming and entertainment. The 16 GB model priced at 9 K is more value for money than this. However I went for 32 GB model as I wanted to store many HD video songs. Got it delivered by flipkart in 24 hrs. This is a tablet I was wanting to buy last year. And at this price it makes sense to grab this. The new nexus 2013 will be mostly priced close to 20 K for 32 GB model. After all this is just an entertainment device and I feel not like spending too much for such a device waiting for the new model... So, at this price the buy is completely justified :)
Planning to buy this. I am planning to buy this tab. Can some one pls confirm: 1. Can we use SIM in this. 2. Is whatsapp supported, if no then does any one know the reason. 3. It appears that it does not have camera. Any other cons.
There is not a better tablet at this price in this world. I have used it for couple of weeks and I have already kept my ipad aside in my cupboard. I was rooting for NEXUS 7 2nd GEN but let me tell you guys it won't come before JAN. And the price of 32 GB won't be any less than 22,000 . So guys buy this or wait for another 3 months to get the 2nd version for double the price. And yes I got it for 12,350 Reasons u need to seriously buy this- 1) It is the cheapest A NEXUS will ever go 2) Best for gaming . This 7 inch monster is even better than my IPAD 3 because of its size and its perfect balance in my hand. Let me tell u this I have played NOVA 3, FIFA 14, ASPHALT 8, REAL RACING 3, REAL FOOTBALL, IRONMAN 3. These games are all above 1 GB. I am a hardcore gamer and when i tell u its good, it really is good. 3)1000 Times better than GALAXY tab3 or 2 or any available model. My friend has it and I have compared it thoroughly. 4) Preety good screen resolution (again better than galaxy tab and ipad mini) 5) Excellent Processor (it just stops at nothing - 2 heavy games , 1 pendrive attached , 1 1080p video playing, Play Store open) 6) Support External Pendrive - so don't be worried about storage(just use an OTG Cable) 7) Sleek good back surface for holding in hand and yes its light weight too 8) U get Latest versions of ANDROID as soon as they are launched. - I am waiting for my KITKAT to be released.
While buying it I thought.... would it b good???? Because I bought it just by seeing the reviews....... But after experiencing it my emotions were just WOW...!!!!!!!
Got the Tab within 48 hrs of ordering. Good Packing. Nexus Brand offers the Best Hardware out there and Flipkart gave it for Best Price. Very Good Buy.
This tab is an excellent choice at this price point. Even though the updated version is going to come soon however this tab does not lack anything.
got my nexus 7 today . working great.. awesome tablet at this price . Initially I had some trouble with my android 4.3 update. It went upto almost 20% and got stuck there for a while. Thankfully it got corrected by itself. All I got to say is that , this tab is worth every penny u spend !
Nexus 7 has proved to be nothing but an item of luxary to me. The 7" screen isn't as vibrant as other Super AMOLEDs, but it's good enough. It's hard to locate pixels. Speaker is very good with MX Player. The body really feels premium. There is no app for camera; front camera is only used in video calling I could catch occassional lag, but in considerable amount. Games run smoothly though. Reading with Play Books feel fantastic. I got pre-loaded with Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean), and swiftly updated it to Android 4.3. So far only one bug noticed! As for the battery life, at low brightness and moderate use it drops 8-10% per hour. It's the purest Google Android, I have ever felt.
I received this tab in flat 2 days. Ordered on Sat evening and received on Mon. Tablet is excellent. Fast, responsive and sufficient storage. built quality could have been better. Camera should have been in the back instead but it doesn't matter (tabs are not used to click pics). There is hardly any lag while playing FIFA 14. I got additional 5% discount (Navratri). Flipkart is reliable.
First i should thank flipkart for its delivery . i actually bought this product as a gift to my cousin who is 8 years old,particularly for games The best choice is go for the same in 16GB variant,its worth. Even after downloading major games like 1.Real Racing 3 game data of 1GB 2.GTA vice city 3.Need for speed most wanted and many more popular games also with some of his favorite Videos nearly around 2GB but still device is having 23GB free memory,whereas the usable is around 29 when android OS is upgraded to 4.3. pretty decent device but its getting heated (it gets heated only after a continuous use of more than 40 minutes) battery is good but its taking more time to charge. also i need to tell u there is not even a single lag experienced till now. my cousin could not keep this device away from him as he is using nearly 10 hours a day on weekends.
itz a gr8 tablet n available at d best cost on flipkart... overall m v.happy wid d tab as well as flipkart :)
I bought this tablet after the recent price drop, and it is a steal at this price. Buttery smooth performance for all tasks, a brilliant screen and awesome battery life make this device a pleasure to own.
got mine just now.. on 7th Oct13. got to me just in 2 days .. thnx to Flipkarts Ekart service. Power,Looks, everything is fantastic on this tab.simply loving it. deserving 5stars cos lets face it.. you cant get this package in 10k mark. :)
Recieved the tab on 2nd day... Fell in love with flipkart.. Nice packaging... Bought it for 12350 on 4th October. .. Till now no issues other than the screen looks washed out. Though its not flipkart's fault.. I searched the web and found that itsthe problem with nexus 7 2012... So no complaints.. I am a serious gamer and believe me its bang for the buck.. Real football, fifa14, dead trigger, FL commando, contract killer, nfs most wanted, each and every game played pretty nicely.. no lag whatso ever.. and the reading experience is also fantastic.. high ppi density.. Overall pretty nice product.. Seriously recommending everyone to buy it....
Just bought the Nexus 7 32gb wifi one. At 12.5k, the tablet is a steal. Performance is very good. No lag, You can load it with plenty of applications without any issue. The display is brilliant, as good as Galaxy Tab 3 (might be even better). You wont find any other STANDARD brand selling a 1GB ram tablet with a QUADCORE processor at this PRICE RANGE with Jelly Bean 4.3 running smoothly. Though there is no back camera, the FRONT camera is sufficient for Video Chat. Even though, it is practically useless for anyone who doesn't have a wifi connection,the fact is if you have Wired internet connection at home, i would recommend getting a D-Link wired router for about 900rs and connecting this device via wifi
best quality, on time(acc. before time:D) and wat can i say?,,,,its awesome....got 4.2 out of box n its android 4.3 am really really appie :D
I bought a 32GB version for 13,500 from flipkart, and only 3 days later found price dropped to 13,000. Obviously, was very disappointed but the 4th day i opened my mail and found a flipkart mail refunding me 500 bucks for my nexus purchase. my happiness was beyond imagination. Fell in love with flipkart after this generous act. About tab, one word would suffice it - awesome. lag free gaming, gorgeous screen and big battery what more can a fellow ask. Great deal on flipkart. just go for it!!
The tablet is sleek and powerful and is definitely worth the money. It has a good processor, a good internal storage size and a good display. The only shortcoming I found was that the tablet does not has a rare camera. Also it would be great if Asus provides earphones along with it. The service of flipkart was also within time and prompt.

I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Now coming to the product, Since this is a google product. There is no need to wait for updates. As we know updates are really essential in getting the maximum performance of your device. As soon as i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The device is now more smoother than previous jelly bean version. The 4325 mah Battery easily last for a day with a usage of 6hrs+ screen on time Which includes gaming and HD movie playback. Now coming to the graphics, Nvidia Tegra 3 relly does the job. Gaming is totally awesome, one can also tell this a gaming tablet. People who want to play HD games in full graphics. Just buy this one.I tested some high graphics graphics like Asphalt 8, Ganstar Vegas, Gangstar Rio, Dungeon Hunter, Riptide 2 every game was maxed out and there was no lags. Multitasking is so fast due to 1GB ram. People who own this device can forget the word lagging. So finally this device really stands out for the price. People whose budget is more say around 25k, then you can wait and go for the nexus 2013. But for now a 32GB storage with all the other mighty features at a price of 13999 is a really a heavenly offer. Thanks to Flipkart.
pl. dont purchase it. the newer version of it would be available in india by the last quarter of the year and the newer version is just awesome got it from one of my cousin from U.S. it has double ppi double resolution display double RAM double battery backup and moreover it costs only a bit higher feom the 2012 version. check on amazon if u dont believe..!! wait and get the better one for the same price
Nexus 7 is the best tab you can find. But 2nd Gen Nexus 7 Tabs are on the way....so, better wait for those!! :D Happy shopping...Flipkart is good! ________________________________________________________________
in next coming weeks nexus 2013 version in going to launch in india which is 80% faster than this version n have more better features than this version.but the biggest problem with nexus tablets in india is their unrepairability.I m eagerly waiting to buy its 2013 version but do anyone thought what if nexus 7 starts troubling when it goes out of warranty such as its display screen or digitiser,battery or charger as there is no official nexus 7 parts avaible in india so how to get it repaired if its display screen gets cracked or it starts troubling when its out of warranty.so till one year we have no tension becuase of having secured waranty but after 1 year when warranty goes off n then if nexus tablet evr troubles then how to get it repaired due to its repair parts lackness
Amzing1 Amazing ! Amazing! Flipkart rocks....At this price the best tablet and..has all the features of a high end tablet. quad core device and comes wid nVidia Tegra chipset. Key Point: BEst Price in Market
Where is V2 (2013 Edition), this is the V1 - but not bad. Does the OS receive any updates. Does it allow patched apps to bypass and How is the battery life in practical aspects. Wished in this late release for Indian Customers, they would have added the memory expandability with tweaked Tegra 3 Chipset. Cellular ?
I would request you customers not to buy this nexus 7 tablet, as it will be discontinued from the market soon , because of the l;launch of the new version of nexus 7 . If possible have patience and ait for some time and get the nexus 7 - 2 . Which has been launched in July 201
My best gadget buddy up till now.... Feel proud to be owner of such a device.... If u planning to buy.... Take it..... Let me also let u know nexus 7 II is on its way also so if u can wait Check out the new one....
Good product at reasonable pricing. Some earlier batches of the tablet(2012),may have screen flicker/casing creak issues but Asus has them covered via international warranty. Coming from the iOS club,must say i'm quite impressed with stock 4.3 JB & overall responsiveness of the tablet. If you need greater control & external storage access etc. then Root. (i.e. add a 3G USB dongle if need to access emails on the move) 7" perfect size for eBooks,browsing & emailing,etc. Extremely portable & light. Get a small keyboard + case, if you do some productive computing like Excel & Word edits while on the move. I found it slightly laggy (Android's scrolling physics) & the colours seem slightly washed out. Battery life is good & if you have tons of multimedia files then choose the 32 GB model. Overall a pleasant experience. PS: flipKart pricing may seem slightly higher but replacements are without questions & quickly implemented. Their Customer Care is getting sloppy on follow up & packaging is sometimes shoddy, but they take feedback seriously & have promised to restore their previous glory :)
in about 15 days d 2nd gen of dis tablet will b launched which is far more better than dis n also cheaper,so guys just wait n get a greater tab really a great tab fantastic tablet from google. hope dis helped
Nexus 7 is available on google site itself. take a look at this and save ur money. its a good product from google. you need google wallet account to buy this from google play store. visit google play store then look for device section.
This is amazing device in that price range. I have used iPad and clarity and responsiveness of the device is no more different than it. High Pixel Density makes UI crystal clear. Fast Quad-core Tegra CPU gives it fluent functioning. Played games with heavy graphics and effects and they run smoothly with all effects visible. Sound quality is superb, though not much louder, it's enough. Standards of the Google in the device gives no need to double think. I would say, if you have that budget range, must go for it, rather than iPad mini or others or even iPad.
First of all, it is a nexus device so you are going to get OTA updates, i.e When any new android version comes out, you will get that update within 2-3 days which can be installed within the device itself with a single tap, no other software needed like you install apps. Android 4.3 update is already available to install . Also, you can install Ubuntu OS upon it using the images available for them at the official website of Ubuntu. It won't affect Your android OS as it can boot separately. Second thing, the hardware is excellent and much better than Galaxy Tabs, the Quad core processor and GPU makes it run butter smooth. There is no lag at all even during multitasking unlike Galaxy tabs which turns into lagdroid. Third thing, Looks are stunning the thickness is just perfect and the build quality is the best you can get, you can compare it with the build quality of apple i-pod touch . Also, the screen is scratch-proof so you don't need a scratch guard for it, if you want to avoid finger prints then buy a matty one. IPS panel screen doesn't turn color into negative shades when tilted owing to viewing angles upto 178 degrees. Fourth, the OS android 4.2 which is apparently 4.3 with an update is stock one, means you get vanilla UI ,the default Android UI and unlike other Bloated User Interfaces it is clean and smooth, you don't get any frame-skips while using it, transitions are smooth. Lack of back camera and expandable slot might bother some people, but that could be managed depending upon once needs, Nexus 7 2nd gen might have one but that will be expensive than this one though. it will be coming on 28 August in US, so you will have to wait till Mid September to get in india. As stated by me it would be costlier by atleast 3-4k due to higher specs. IMO if you want to get best of android , can manage without a back cam, Click on BUY NOW button without a second thought .
this tablet is not good and very expensive. there are many other tablets better than this one with better features and less expensive. please do not buy this ever. you can try other tablets. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
So, I got this for myself and my sister, and this is awesome! Every game works, the screen is big enough, but not too big. The pixels are so bright, it gives the illusion of having density comparable to the Galaxy S4 or HTC One. It runs Jelly Bean out of the box, it's the first to get any update, and can easily be rooted/bootloader unlocked/any other modification you can think of. However, the thing does have problems. The battery doesn't work for more than 7-8 hours. This may not be an issue for me, but it probably will be for anybody expecting full portability. Also, it has no microSD slot. That means no matter what you want, you'll never get more than what comes inside. Other than these two problems, this is a great buy, for tinkerers and public alike.
Pros: Nice processor 1.3 Ghz Quadcore ( my rating 4.6 /5) Performance s better while comparing with Samsung Tab 2 ( my rating 4.8 /5) Best resolution while comparing with Samsung Tab 2 ( my rating 4.6 /5) Scratchless display ( my rating 4.4 /5) latest version of android 4.2.2 Best battery life while compare with other tablets ( almost 10hr) ( my rating 4.7 /5) front cam is nice ( my rating 4 /5) Cons: No call facility(I think no one use tab for CALLING,if u need to call,use an app which can call with ur tab while mob and tab is in wifi network) no back cam (i think its not a problm,no one use it for taking photos) The cons are not valid.So i prefer this tab to everyone rather than any other tab in this price range
Bought the 32GB N7 (Wi-fi) for 19K last week and I am telling you it's the best 7" Tablet. Tegra 3 Quad Core Processer with Geforce ULP GPU can beat the sh*t out of those high end gadgets out there. The display is crisp, it has a higher pixel density than those Galaxy tablets. What else do you need? Btw, If you are looking for a tablet to take photographs then you are on the wrong page.
Swayam bought this product but he create confused. He just say "WiFI + 3g point right". Here is the actual detail. In India You can bought Asus Nexus (this) , 2. Amazon Kindle HD. 3. Samsung tablet. All other from Sony and other brand are come at very big cost or cheaper quality product. Don't be confused with company like Micromax, Iball, and some other. All of them made their product in China. You can't expect more then 3 year life from those cheap china product. All 3 consider product have some different. For best product I suggest people to go with Amazon HD. The reason is about Better pixel-density and in comparison you can figure out that they have better thing at the price people gave something less. This one (asus) have good quality. Why not you look at Youtube before bought one. Youtube show the product when people trying to fake the feature.
The Galaxy Nexus 7 Tab is an extraordinary device in many ways and has been launched in india by google in april 2013. Its 16 gb version is available on google play, while the 32 gb and 32 gb with gsm are internationally available. Key Features ITS ANDROID :- google's Android is well known for its user friendly approach and what's a better device than Google Nexus 7. It comes with out of the box 4.1 jellybean and has online upgrades provided by google making it most updated(Now 4.2.2 is available). Tegra 3:- It has tegra 3 T30 1.3 Ghz quad core with nvidia ULP GPU (12 core). This mean it has all the firepower for the best and most demanding games in android market effortlessly. Tegra 3 uses THD version of games which are different (Better and stable) from normal ones. In comparison to Mali 400 (8 core) its better in performance and has low power consumption, meaning longer battery life. Memory:- It has 1 Gb ddr3 ram with 16/32 gb internal memory depending on version u buy with NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY OR USB SLOTS. Networking :- It has wifi and has NO DONGLE SUPPORT. Display :- The display is nice but not exception with lower colour saturation and brightness than say AMOLED screens. Still great for the price. Rooters:- Its ideal for people who like to root and change roms as its a very popular device having thosusands of roms and rooted apps available in addition to google updates. Price:- Its decently price and a great value for money with its built quality and performance. Sound:- has good Audio quality on speakers but NOT SO GREAT with earphones. Customer care:- 1 year limited warranty. If bought from Google play u get GOOGLE Support. Else u have to go to ASUSTEK the manufacturer. Final Verdict :- For non-techies it still dishes a gr8 experience with its high performance and quality. Its very attractively designed and light in weight. Its perfect for techies and gamers and they simply cant ask for more than this at this price. The only turnoffs are non expandable memory and no calling facility(except the gsm version) though my personal fav is 16GB one. Its not called BEST OF GOOGLE for no reason.
pros: looong battery life touch sensitivity is too good cons: if battery dried out, then the screen will start flashing, when you connect to charger, you will not know what is happening for 2,3 days - black out NO USB, NO MEMORY CARD, NO SIM CARD... so, pls stop comparing with samsung p3100 or..., i feel samsung is a good choice...
This is THE best gadget you can treat yourself with, at this budget. It has awesome specs and reviews tell the reality. Its Competition is with Samsung Tab 2 P3110 (16 GB WiFi Only Model) However the samsung tab is available at around 9,000 INR but it has its downsides 1. Dual Core processor (Nexus has Quad Core) 2. TouchWiz UI (Nexus has Stock(pure) Android ) 3. Cheap Build quality (Nexus has premium build quality) 4. 16 GB Space(Nexus 7 32GB).. and many more... Google Nexus 7 Actually Rocks !
really great specs for the price . gaming is such a charm in the device .the pricing of flipkart is same as that of play store but dont know why only the 32 gb version is available here pesonally i love to have the 16 gb version hoping htat it will be available soon in flipkart .........
great product.. @amal right bro the 16 gb version offers more value for money ...waiting for the 16 gb version .this one is great too (didnt has one youtubing knowledge ) i tried the play store to buy it but it wont accept my debit card . so i hav to wait for flipkart
. really great compared to galaxy tab ... a small rooting will gave you access to 3g usb stick as well . but an extra 3000 for 16 gb is really awful. i personally prefer the 16 gb version hope it will be available in the flipkart soon .... my bro is eagerly waiting for thatttt
its a very good deal for the price. One of my frnd had one,far better compared to galaxy tab p3100 . The price in play store is almost similar but flipkart should avail the 16 gb also which offers more value for money and dont worry about the storage usb streaming is great in n7 (may need rooting ). In total the tab is a great experiance but the 16 gb one could hav been more better considering value for money
Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet@@@don't think we have a better tablet in < 11 K price range. 4.3 upgrade is available. smooth experience, better than samsung tablet which costs greater than 14K .. -ve (no back camera .. not sure why we need a back camera if we have a smartphone.)
Zahur ahmed, where did you buy it from? Try contacting the place where you bought it from at the same time search for service centers. It will help you solve the problem faster.
The performance is good. Sound quality and display are great for the price. The software gets updated as and when there is 1 available. I could not vedio chat using hangouts so far. Need to check on this. Battery standby is good, but full charge doesn't stand even 10 hrs of constant use. to conserve battry you may switch off some of the services like auto rotate or wifi depending on your requirement. This increases the batery life considerably. I used the Maps app to guide me driving to new places. there is no need to talk of flipkart its just excellent.
The tablet is good for reading books and playing HD games,mind you,by HD I mean games like Injustice,NFS Hot Pursuit,Batman and the like.Video playback quality is superb and reminds you of Apple's Retina display. But only wifi and not even a 3g dongle support is why I give this great tablet a four star rating.
After i brought this, within 2 months the tab is not getting charging. No i am searching for the service provider where this can be fixed. I have no idea if my tab will be replace or they will do something.
It was a steal at these price levels. A Great branded Tab at an honest price. It does what it's supposed to.
I liked the Nexus 7 very much after I had a chance to experience it at a shop and so decided to purchase it. The looks are premium and the experience whether applications like games or even internet surfing via browser is excellent. Even movies are a joy to watch on it. Completely worth the money. But a 32 GB tablet like the I bought is really worth getting over the 16GB version.
I am very much willing to buy nexus 7 but I have some doubts in my mind.I would really appreciate if a user can answer my questions. 1. Does it come with screen gaurd and earphones? 2. can I use otg on it without rooting? 3. does kitkat work without any lag or hiccups? 4. can i transfer files from my pc to n7? 5. how is the after sales support? 6. i found somewhere that the screen is washed out,want to know more about it? thanks in advance
This truly is the best tablet available in the Indian market. Forget those over-priced or below-standard tabs. This is just right. Believe me, there is nothing in the Play Store which you cant use on this device. Better not go for the 2013 edition and stick to this 2012 one. You wont repent.
This is my first tab and the review is after using it almost for a month. Firstly, though it's a 2012 model, it is way ahead of the competitors in terms of performance for the given price range...The processor is fast and the RAM is sufficient for multitasking and games. Here are 7 features of the Nexus 7 which I like the most: 1. Ample space: ~26gb (you can store anything and everything-movies, songs, games, apps......) 2. Screen: The screen quality and resolution is good for watching movies 3. Processor: NVidia Tegra Quad Core processor is capable to run high end games smoothly (Real Racing, Asphalt 8...) 4. Build quality and looks are good 5. Google: It will ensure that your is tab is always up-to-date. 6. Battery: It is just Ok but sufficient for day-to-day activities (surfing, movies, games...) 7. Touch response is buttery smooth - no lag whatsoever. I would be more delighted if- - There was a rear camera - There was screen guard/earphone in the box - Flipkart had reduced the price when I bought it ! (I got it for 11.5k, then is was available for 11k) Overall satisfied with the product and flipkart service :)
Its not impressive as thought. No Camera, no port. Only good for games and music. Display is good.I recommend others to analysis the usage of product before buying it.
guys this is awsume tablet in this price range and razing sharp display.i m hardcore gamer n believe me guyz this tablet is made for hardcore gamers.it consist of teagra 3 .samsung n other available tablets are nothing in front of nexus 7.
Got this for 11k! Iv'e been using it for 2 months now and haven't had a problem with it! Games such as fifa 14 , and real racing , gt racing are amazing on this! Becomes slightly hot after long usage. It connects to my dslr pretty easily! Also managed to install whatsapp on it. IT DOESN'T FEEL OUTDATED AT ALL!!
Firstly - Awesome service by FLIPKART! I got the product within 24 hours of ordering. Fantastic packaging too. Reason for buying another tablet: I wanted to buy a tablet for my 2 yr old daughter - YES 2 yrs old... She WANTS TO PLAY with my iPad, my Lumia phone and my wife's iPhone. Though she handles the gadgets very carefully without dropping, she doesnt exactly know what she is playing with so sometimes some contacts would get dialled, or some info gets deleted. Why Nexus 7 2012: We thought of buying a 4k-5k tablet and quickly realized that it is way below in quality and performance - especially display. the closest was the Lenovo for 5k and the iBall 9inch tablet for 7k. but we did some quick comparisons and found out that this is actually a Superb tablet for 11k and also beats the iPad mini (without retina) in many ways. Hence we decided to buy this and use this for our daughter to play games and - we can also use this for our own home purpose while we can keep our other expensive gadgets away from the kid and use it strictly for work. Pros: 1. 32GB is Killer! get all the games / apps u want 2. quad pro processor is faster than anything in competition 3. fantastic display 4. thin and light Cons: 1. No Back Camera, only front for video chat etc 2. Only 1 GB ram - but thats ok as the processor is pretty fast itself 3. No 3G facility 4. No video output facility so u cant hook it up to a TV etc
If you're looking for a 7-inch tablet, we'll put it like this: there is no better alternative on the market. It's not quite as good as the new iPad mini, but if you don't fancy iOS this is the tablet you want
If you have no budget to buy an ipad then google nexus is the next best choice to buy. Its much user friendly in comparison to ipad. You can copy any data from your external hard disc with much ease. Most of the google apps are free for download as well. Iam sure you will not repent for the choice made
This tablet is amazing at this price range...... Pros :- Stock Android UI which is easy to use .. NVIDIA Processor..... it works superbb for gaming... NO lags in FULL HD movies.... Itz also having GOOGLE NOW.... by which we can work without touching fingers. 10 point multi touch... Games like FRUIT NINJA, AE Slash etc... can we played easily.. Touch is amazing... it works very well and the keyboard is also optimized my ASUS. Now its very very easy to typpe.... (even compared to iOS 7.1.1) THIS IS THE BESTESTEST among all these... insects (Galaxy tab 3, Acer etc..) AND I am sure..... you wouldn't try find more dummies..... bcoz its... superbbb
Hi all, I received the product in 4-5 days of placing the order and as always Flipkart's service and package is rated 5star. Coming to the product, Nexus 2012 is one of the best tablet in the price range and worth paying for it. Go for it..!! :)
Bought it for my nephew for his birthday. He is very happy with the product. excellent service form flipkart
I was impressed how Google could pack so much into such a cheap tablet. Pros: - Good battery life. Lasts upto 24 hours with medium usage. - Awesome display. HD movies are a delight to watch on this tab. - Updated to Android 4.4 KitKat. Brings an infinite number of apps. And a sexy user interface. - The back is very aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. - Stock Android on first boot. So, no unnecessary and cluttering apps all over the home screen. Cons: - Lacks an SD card slot. However, this should not be a problem if 32 gigs will suffice for you. - No HDMI output port. That means this tab can't be connected to the TV. - No call facility. But of course, I personally don't prefer walking in public with a 7" tablet stuck to my ear. - Largely dependent on WiFi. Since 3G feature is missing, not much can be done apart from playing games or navigating an offline map when there is no WiFi signal around.
This is the best tab for the price u pay. Updates itself with android 4.4 kitkat. NO lags. been playing HD games on this and they work perfectly.
This is a great tablet at an awesome price. It has not given any problems and the battery easily lasts for 24 hours. It gives around 27 GB of usable space and supports all the usual apps. I do not intend to use it for any heavy graphic games but games like Deer Hunter run very well.
5 stars rating for Superfast delivery by Flipkart & Nexus device is as like other Nexus products, Highly recommended device.
Everything is good.. Upgadeble to Kitkat Good For Playing Games Nice Touch 32GB Internal is Enough No USB Port/U Have to Buy a OTG cable cost around 90-150 to use USB nice Wifi In One Word "Excellent"
good product but flipkart should offer an stylus free whit this tab overall good in perfomance and must buy tab a very sensitive touch responce and with an android 4.4 kitkat update
I'm not able to play games on this tablet. games are not loading properly and they stuck on loading screen. downloaded many games of larger size e.g. Contract Killer, contract killer 2, minion rush, GTA, Asphalt 8 etc. all these game are stuck on loading screen. Overall bad product for me
2 days flat delivery on COD. Impressed with Flipkart. Product-Good but the wifi connectivity has some issue. Same position, other devices connect far easier. Connected with Google guys, no resolution. Anyways, overall experience is good, could have been better though.
Incredible in design and speed. No disadvantage No lagging. All games run smoothly. Updated to latest android 4.4. Guys go for it.
It's about 2 weeks since my google nexus 7 arrived. The delivery was pretty fast and it's a great tablet. I had been warned by retailers here not to buy it as service for this product is non existent. But having heard so many good things about it I went ahead anyway and so far am happy. The wireless speed is terrific, and it works smoothly. The first time round I had the feeling the battery didn't last too long but I notice that with the second charge it's going longer. Charging time is about 3 hours. I've been using the tab mainly for reading e-books but it's also fine for mailing. Am not into games or anything so can't say much about that.
If you need a device for games and wifi browsing.....NExus 7 is the way to go..Its simple easy and pretty handy
Great built & Amazing quality, Perfect for rooters & Android hard core gamers and of course Great price by Flipkart. Thank you very much Flipkart.
Amazing offer from flipkart. got this awesome gadget for 10k. service was fast. product in good condition. Also, this is the best tablet at such cheap price.
this tablet have bluetooth device ..... and sim support .... plzz tel me that i want to buy this tablet but few imformation has not given so m confused no doubt google tab is awwsme
As always delivered by flipkart at time. Best android product ever. No fuss features in this tab, though it does not have calling features but who uses tab for calling.
this is, hands down, the best android tablet that I have used till date. even though the processor and gpu is almost 2 years old it is blazing fast. android 4.4 works buttery smooth on this tablet. games like asphalt 8 and riptide gp 2 works without the slightest of hickupps or freezing. shopping on flipkart was an excellent experience.
All I can say this a product worth of money you investing. From every aspect I can rate it 10 out of 10. Has 1.5 Ghz nvidia processor, 1gb ddr3 ram.. superfast..never lags whatever game u play. Superb graphics support for watching HD video. Only little problem in the speaker inside it. Sound is low. Battery life is also superb. U can run it almost 1day with whatever operation u want to do.
it has 1 gb ddr3 ram it suks but .... it has12 core gpu and quad core processor total 16 core tablet good one it is official google product so it get update fast.. it is good for developer i ike it ..better then ipad hehe
In this budget this is the best you can get, In india we certainly dont have WI FI available everywhere , in most places it's not there, and if you are a traveller without a phone with a wifi hotspot fecility and 3g , then you better reconsider, else this is an awesome device, While gaming, the tablet heats up a bit, But I guess thats okay keeping in mind the heavy size of them .
nice specification and performance no back camera very good for our price...............................................
everyone who love to read books and play games must have this tablet. the build quality is nice. hardware is good too. great experience using it!
A product worth its price; gorgeous looking; smooth running. A good time saving device, a utility product. Nexus manual that is available online details how to use it for the 'first time' tablet users. The delivery was prompt and the product unscarred. Cons: The screen often blinks: more light to less light; less to more.
Inspite being a shipment problem, The seller has replaced it ASAP and the tablet is one such thing which you cannot avoid buying it!! The Retailer is a prompt seller and looking forward to buy more goods....
Tablet is very nice. I am not a heavy user. So I think battery is also good. Pros: Battery Life Plain android build Cons: Speaker is not that good.
This android tablet represents very good value for money. It is well built and has a good quality feel. It has a clear, high quality display and functions well.
Its a great product in an great pricing, i have updated the android version 4.1 to 4.4 kitkat, and its work very smoothly, truly its an amazing product...
The packing was good. The product was delivered in time as promised. I was bit disappointed when i saw there was a price drop the next day i received it.
Value for money. Cheapest tablet from Google. resolution is a delight at this price point. Delivered in 2 days.
Being the Google's own product, there is nothing to think of. If you have the budget to buy Nexus 2013, go for it or else this is the best option.
IMPORTANT: After unboxing, you may see that the tablet is not turning on for the 1st time and there is no charging indicator when u plug in the charger. DONT PANIC, Usually this product ships with fully discharged battery. So it wont turn on right that moment. Connect your charger and leave it for 1 hour. There may be no charging indicator on screen for 1st 20 mins. Dont worry. after a little charge it will show the charging indicator properly. PROS: Display quite good with good viewing angles. Amoled users may feel color is not that vivid. But that's natural coz it's LCD. Battery backup is awesome unlike samsung and sony tabs.. Sound quality is absolutely awesome. Just use a perfect earphone and install/buy poweramp music player (costs max 120 rupees from playstore. I bought it at 60Rs) and set the equalizer to "ROCK", increase bass 50%, increase treble 100%, increase Stereo X 30%. And you are done. Touch is supersensitive. Processor and ram is more than sufficient. Wifi signal reception power is higher than samsung and sony tabs and phones. NFC works like charm. Instant OS updates from google. Easily rootable and unrootable. CONS: The bundled charger for this tablet says it has 2 Amp output ... But actually it's 1 Amp or less... Coz it charges the device very very slowly. I used Sony 2 Amp charger and it's 3X faster than the bundled charger. No OTG support.
Great product at awesome price. Superfast and best tab available in the market. Flipkart delivery was as usual perfect.
Facing lot of issue while operating Google nexus TAB. Issue : 1) Hanged so many times and issue resolved when i power on/off the button again. 2) Keypad is also not working properly..Not typing same word at a time. 3) Get heated while charging even charger also get heated. 4) Few application start by own and off as well.Looks like device MAD some times. Please either replace the product or return back my money..
I tried calling using skype. The front camera launched but the display of the camera window is freezing.It doesnt show the image at all. I have requested a return from Flipkart.Let us see if they help.
Any one who is considering for a video and audio consumption device should buy this. The display is not very bright but otherwise overall the quality is perfect. absolute no lag, good performace
Till 45 days work flawlessly . After that Touch screen is not working . Device is not in hang state but you can't do any operation apart from screen rotation . Pathetic . Now i need to run for service centers .
Guys its the best android tab out in the market with the best price. I am very happy with this tab. :D
The product is excellent and thanks to flipkart i got the delivery in time to gift it to my father. He is enjoying his movie on the nexus
My friends were saying that nexus does not have a good battery life , but this lasts upto 8 hrs max and supports all games with great graphics , without hesitating you can buy , only thing is that it becomes little hot when you use it for 1 hour continuously. Otherwise it is "PERFECT".....
FLIPKART SERVICE RATING - 10/10 REVIEW - NEXUS 2012 Pros - 1) GREAT DISPLAY - NOT LIKE NEXUS 2013 BUT STILL BEST FOR ITS CLASS 2) PURE ANDROID 3) BUILD QUALITY 4) GAMING - NVIDIA TEGRA 3 5) SIZE - 7INCH GREAT FOR CARRY.(POCKET SIZED/SLIM) 6 )PROCESSOR - QUAD CORE 7) NFC SUPPORT 8) BATTERY SUPPORTS UP 7-8 HOURS Cons - 1) NO SIM SUPPORT 2) NO BACK CAMERA Conclusion - FOR 11.5K GREAT DEAL
Item as described...well packed...delivered on the very next day...works great. Suggest that Flipkart should sell scratch guard also as combo. Also, Flipkart need to provide full technical specification for all the products sold. But for these, it was a very good experience. Thanks.
Item exactly as described. My daughter is very happy with it. Prompt and very fast shipping. Think its the lowest price in this country. The only thing it should have included is call facility. will recommend strongly. God bless flipcart. Regards Meena
using it for almost 5-6 months no issues with the tablet. Easy to use and good screen navigation. Google definitely beat every other tablet in this range
I have been using it for nearly a month and I am completely satisfy with its performance . I have almost stopped using my laptop (except transferring my old stuff to tab) . If you are looking for all in one without calling tab look no further just buy this tab. Web browsing , skype, viber , video chat, games just amazing and the new Nexus 7 has a hidden magnetic lock / unlock functionality like ipad.
pros: thin & light, nice finish material luks premium, good rear grip. nice bright screen, good touch response. cons: battery back up while gaming. heats up quickly during heavy gaming, but thats normal i gues no other tab comes close to what this one provides at this price.. flipkart delivery service awesm..
My apologizes to all the N7 fan boys; but the tab is not all that great as it is hyped to be. It is OK I believe that 8" is the sweet spot of tab screen size so this one might feel smaller to some iboys like me. Another thing the gaming performance is nowhere close to that of the iPad (even the mini). Here is how to improve the lifespan of the N7 1. Invest in a good case, you can never go wrong with that 2. Don't game for long periods, If you see the kind of chip-set in the tab it needs ventilation support which the tab does not have, the chip-set might be able to take the heat but what about the other components? 3. Switch it off when not in use for prolonged period. Believe me guys this is a computer grade hardware and it is always recommended to shut it down when not in use.
There is very nice product but .it have no Sim- card ..so , it is not self working instrument it is depend by WI-Fi ..there is not useful instrument in field work.
First of all great service by flipkart people and also making it available in UP. As for as tablet its a great buy if you want to buy a 7 inch tablet , its fast and buttery smooth Though no 3g but 32gb space,price,performance and brand name make up for it and u can always connect over wifi.
this tablet is awesome guys I am telling you and is much better than apple products but the points comes on the price of the tablet its rs 10999 . I want to tell the flipkart people just reduce the price
Received the product. Overall the performance is good. Fast delivery. It was a good experience to shop with Flipkart.
Pros: 1) Great Display 2) Pure Android by google. So u will get latest updates. 3) Build Quality is nice. Also has premium looks. Cons: 1) Bit heavy 2) Back Camera would be an nice addition. Conclusion: For 11.5k it is definitely worth buying.
My nexus 32GB is about 3 months old and ma screen got cracked.How do i get it replaced and changed. I need a reply soon coz the tablet is really useful and i don't want to waste time. The tablet is awesome.
Excellent tablet. User friendly. Good resolution. Excellent price. I love this tablet. Good buy from Flipkart.
its been a month since im using this tablet , felt very satisfied for its amazing features at such a low price, dropped my precious for a few times but not even a scratch..again thumbs up for its built quality. my only complain with this product is that it has a very small charging wire which hinders me from my sleeptime entertainment. NEXUS 7 ZINDABAAD !
4 Stars for the Nexus 7 2012 tablet. It is awesome VFM. Reducing 1 star for not have SIM card slot. 1 Star has been reduce for the seller because when I opened the back cover, I found distinct Finger Prints on one of the parts inside, which could mean that someone played with it and it is NOT A NEW product or it is a REFURBISHED one. I use it occasionally for web browsing, checking emails, hangouts, playing games, etc. It is mostly used by my son who enjoys playing lot of games and reading ebooks. I find the tab to be good enough for the above purpose. I would recommend the product, however, I am not sure about the seller.
First of all thanks to Flipkart, for making available this device in stock. i was looking it in market (Nehru Place, Delhi) so that i can margin in its price. But unfortunately, it wasn't available in their stock. so i ordered it through flipkart, i was keep tracking this device through my tracking order number. finally, after 2 days, i received this. i was so excited. Successfully Updated it in Kitkat 4.4.2.. But unfortunately, pure KitKat having some bugs, related to third party camera apps, such as Skype, well Skype is working fine, but in background its eating my tab's battery.. giving me talktime of 5 to 6 hours.. After searching thousand of forums, i found that i am not all alone. many Kitkat users having same battery issue with their devices.. (Moto G users also)..

Well, i think there is no reason for not buying it.. after all you are going to experience a better new technology.. Thanks for reading.. :)
I purchased this product with specific object of replacing my aging PC. To use this tab instead of PC for day to day usage. It has met my expectation except low battery life needs frequent recharging as compared to my expectation and the OTG cable could not be used until and unless you download a paid app.
The product is a good buy given the price. The tab is of good build, superior display, and a great configuration.
I bought a 32gb version nexus 7 2012 from flipkart.Initially i received a faulty product which was replaced in a week through easy replacement policy. The tab itself was stunning for the money paid. I bought this tab for my 9 month old son. We used to feed him by playing rhymes &video songs in it,He stops crying whenever i play a video from it. It is a must have for parents with toddler who wants to keep their little one happy.Most important thing is the tab works very well even after brutally abused everyday by my little one. Thank you flipkart for selling a nice product in a very reasonable price ?
Nexus 7 with 32 GB is a good to go daily use tablet. Tegra 3 performance is very good and this tablet is quite responsive and more than worth the cost. Use this for gaming, daily use and entertainment along side your work. If you are a geek you could install Ubuntu and start towards convergence. The docking pin will help u more towards convergence. Android 4.2 Jelly bean would suffice for all users. For advanced users looking at hacking the hardware, you can look at ARM version of debian or debian based kali linux.
Gr8 Assurance again unbelievable product best in the business quality at due deliverance . Thank you vendor, gr8 time lines.
A great device...it does not come loaded with all the junks you get in a Sony, Samsung devices....Extremely smooth and easy to use...Google Now is amazing....Resolution is quite good at this price...you have around 28 GB of user available storage...what more do you want at this price??...need to install some android games to take advantage of the Geforce GPU and Tegra chipset....One word of caution for those who receive a device with zero battery charge...please get a samsung 150-300V smartphone charger to charge up the device...I received mine with zero charge and so connected it to the in-box charger and waited for one hour before starting it...and when I push the power button...it just showed screen flickering and I sorta panicked...but I then decided to plug in my samsung note 2 charger and voila the device started up....and one more advice crying that the device doesn't have SD card slot...Get a USB OTG and buy the Nexus Media Importer from Google Play....and you will have all the storage you want...I connected my Seagate Backup Plus and its good to go...enjoy the device...don't overwork it....and I am sure it wll stay alive for quite sometime....
Don't expect an awesome table if it has NVidia quad core processor it ain't that impressive Got 13000 on antutu benchmark Rest is amazing nic display' Plays HD 1080p video's and some HD games
The only defect is it doesn't have the back camera. So please make sure you are aware of it. rest all is fine
Its a super smooth and great on performace tablet, and with the slim looks for others to envy.Its a great tablet and worth every penny of your purchase.
Very Nice,fast good performance 32 GB storage tablet in Rs.10,999. Now I have updated my tablet to Android 4.4 & there are lot of free Apps in android market. Graphics are very nice & gaming performance is also very smooth.I am fully satisfied with this device.
I bought this product at 15k.Here are my views: 1)This device has the worst display and build quality.While using,you will find cracks on the displays,lines etc, even after gentle use. 2.)Dont trust asus.coz they say its corning glass.but scratches occur easily. 3.)very low sound. 4.)after sales support from flipkart. 5.)no warranty. pros:) 1.)good battery back up. So,hereby I will never trust asus and never buy anything from flipkart....
Product is not upto the satisfatory price................................... keeps on hanging............ memory space is also not good................................................... and many more
The product is faulty. After 2 months of usage the nexus tablet stopped working. Lately I heard feedback from other people also that electronics products from flipkart tends to be faulty. Look for other sites.
i want to purchase this product but i don't no the quality of this product please help me some one this is good product
This is a very good tablet with good quality. None of the tablets around this price range is comparable, it is way above. The processor, speed, response and display were awesome. Battery should provide more backup, but other tablets in this price range giving just 1/3 times compare to this. Camera is not up to the expectation. Tablet does not have all the latest features. It will be better if available for lesser price.
It has lot of Google apps installed, like Google Music, Download Manager, etc. After disabling all Google bloat, it has long battery life, no unnecessary data usage and so smooth. Best for gaming and fine for ebook reading.
This is a long post. Read it if you're interested in knowing about my pleasant experience with Flipkart's (WS Retail) replacement guarantee. I recently purchased a Google Nexus 7 tablet from Flikpart on 4th March 2014. The tablet was delivered on time and I was really happy using it. But a couple of weeks later I saw that there was a dead pixel on the screen. As it was right in the middle of the screen, it was really annoying. So I decided to opt for a replacement, as items sold by WS Retail have a 30 day replacement guarantee. Read on... Day 1: I called Flipkart at around 9:30AM and told them that I had an issue with my tab and asked for a replacement. I was promised a call back within 24 hours. With the kind of impatient person I am, I decided to send them some tweets regarding this too. After 3-4 tweets, I finally got a reply that I will be called back soon. Day 2: It had already been 24 hours and I was getting paranoid by now. I called Flipkart again and I was promised a call back soon. I tweet them angrily few more times, send an email and also wrote a very "angry" post on their Facebook wall expressing my disappointment of not getting a call back within 24 hours. I am really starting to get worried here and all kinds of thoughts like "they will never replace my tab, I have to live with this defective tab now" blah blah started creeping in my mind. Finally after around 30 hours since I first called them, I got a call back from a Flipkart representative. I was super elated. The representative apologized for the inconvenience politely and asked me what was the issue with my tab. I explained and after a few basic questions, he approved my refund! I was relieved. And within 2 hours of this call, I got an email that WS Retail had already shipped my replacement tab via Bluedart. Bluedart tracking showed delivery by 26th March. My faith in Flipkart which had gone bleak since the last 24 hours started getting stronger again. Day 3: There was some mobile network outage whole day in my area and in the evening when network returned to normal, I got a text from their courier partner ekart that they tried to contact me for the reverse pickup but couldn't reach my phone. The text also mentioned that a pickup would be attempted tomorrow. Day 4: At around 12:30PM the ekart pickup guy arrives and I hand over the defective tablet to him. He examines and packs it and hands me over an acknowledgement. I was bit sad that I had to live without a tab till 26th March (expected delivery of my replacement tab). But to my pleasant surprise, while I was closing the gate after the ekart pickup guy left, two Bluedart guys arrive with my replacement Nexus 7! 4 days before the expected delivery date! I couldn't believe that this was actually happening! I signed the consignment receipt and came inside with a big smile on my face. I open the package and saw a brand new, shining, sealed Nexus 7 inside. I turn it on and its working like it should and I'm typing all this with a happy and smiling face on my Nexus 7! So within 4 days, I got my defective tablet replaced. Thank you, Flipkart for fulfilling your commitment before expected time limits and over exceeding my expectations. Damn, I started doubting Flipkart for the first time since 2012 (when I placed my first order with them) and they have put all my doubts to rest efficiently and with perfection. Love you, Flipkart. I am so happy that I might send some return gifts to Flipkart! Thanks to the Flipkart executives who attended my calls, their social media team for bearing my angry posts and tweets and always replying with extreme politeness and a sense of assurance. Thumbs up, guys!
I bought it from flipkart a mnth ago and I am fully satisfied with its performance. Game performance is too good. it is able to play any video even 1080. Battery backup is awsme, for an average use u can get an 1.5 day or 2 day battery power. Display quality is also good & an good viewing angle. The defects are for an net connection u hve only an wifi, device will get hot at the back bottom when u r playing high end games, no rear camera and also memoryis not expandable
This is THE best android tablet available in the 15,000 price bracket. Period. If you are looking for a tablet with 15,000 (for 32 GB) just buy it without even thinking about samsung or micromax. Positives: 1. Excellent build quality, easy and comfortable to hold in one hand 2. Thin and light-weight, very portable (you can carry it in your jean's backpocket) 3. Very sharp display, very nice color 4. Very powerful quad-core processor and nvdia 12 core gpu that makes this product deliver performance without any lag 5. Google stock android 4.4.2 kitkat update the moment you power on the device and trust me its again an awesome software from Google 6. Good sound quality from speaker and headphones 7. Great battery life 8. Good wifi connectivity All in all i am very satisfied with the product and recommend it whole heartedly.
very happy with flipkart's fast delivery this tablet is really value for money but its charger is not working hope problem will be resolved soon
the nexus 7 ,got in to my hands earlier than the estimated delivery date,time to review pros: 1)people who want to have an decent tab for the price of 10k go for nexus7 (2012) because by far this is the best tab for such a low price and its worth waiting for few more days because the price may drop by 1K 2)people who want to choose between nexus 7 and dell venue 7 go for nexus 7 becz the venue 7 display sucks in real time ,and venue 7 is running 4.2 and hope they are not gonna update it to 4.3 ,battery sucks in venue 7 so its obvious to choose nexus 7 3)google OTA updates cons: 1)When we fill up storage to the point of having less than around 3GB free, the firmware triggers a process that runs "unusually slow and can lock up the whole device for several seconds." 2) there are many cases reporting that the nexus 7 is getting slower and slower after few months ,may be hardware issue in some tablets 3)display edges are too delicate and more accident prone ,need to handle with care 4)multiple reboots and battery drain is most common after 4 months
best tablet under 15k. if you can afford nexus 2013 great. if not forget samsung etc just buy this tablet.
Its worth paying, iam happy with this product. So easy to carry and comfortable to use. So comfortable to read books.
Really nyc to have this Nexus..! If there is a Primary camera..! then this will rocks ..! Good vedio clarity and sound..! Browsing speed gud with WiFi
There is nothing to say wrong with the product at the flipkart price. The great thing is that the service provided by the flipkart is incomparable. Even most of popular shopping sites can't provide satisfaction at this much extent. Now my first and final preference is flipkart. About the product. As owned by Google, that is sufficient to say that product will be amazing. Nice clarity and best resolution with compatible hardware configuration. Well satisfied at the price of INR 10,999.00
THe wifi does not turn on once i have updated to kitkat. I have to manually reboot the device before it is able to connect to wifi.
Google nexus a great tablet easy to use easy to maintain.... very helpful in daily routine work. and the price is just appropriate as compare to its other tablets in market....
great and easy to use. recommended for lite users. Have been using it for a week now without a hitch. Lack of primary camera is a hindrance but does not greatly devalue the product
No words to praise ....... It's a master piece at a damn cheap price. Hats off to Google and ASUS. I Thank all the people who were behind the development of this product.
Very neat. Does what is expected. No significant cons. Just the adapter failed and had to get a replacement. Otherwise will recommend this
Please do not buy this product. i bought this two weeks ago and the screen is just too fragile. it broke already. it fell on the bed and the whole screen cracked. i will not recommend this tab to anyone unless you can really take care too well. i will give the built quality a 1.
Awesome tab. It's having the same graphic card which is in Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 You should buy it if you are a true android gamer..Thumbs Up
Purchased this product after a lot of research & so far satisfied with its performance(15 days). Here am mentioning a few cons & hopefully it may help fellow buyers- 1.It is a old model manufactured around March-13(all most all nexus shipped by Ws retail) ,Therefore product you gonna use is getting switched on after a long idle time & this hampers its battery performance drastically.No where near what Nexus claims. Even less than 30% brightness & a minimum app running background i am getting around 5-6 hour when the screen is on continuously. 2. Android app market for tablet is bullshit.. a lot are just a stretched version of mobile & it looks very awkward on the tablet. 3.Inbuilt sound is less but if use earphone(good pair in the earphone) that will solve your problem. 4.I am not impressed by the screen resolution its not crisp & somewhat faded...May be my eye acquainted to high ppi on my smartphone. 5.It's getting a hot while charging. 6.Occasional lag(Android has this inherited problem) but not a concern for non gamer like me. Overall value for money..If you can cope with these problems than go make a purchase right now. Am satisfied with flipkart service but they should refrain from cheap pricing policy if they want to build long term relation with their customer.I purchased this tablet at Rs.11499 & just after a couple of days price get reduced by rs.500.
Its been a week using this tab. Awesome is the word for this tablet with respect to the price. Not writing the specs, but the experience I have got so far - Pros - - Display is good with Gorilla glass, offering peace of mind against scratches. But a screen is recommended. - Tegra 3 is awesome with respect to response. No lags what so ever. Also, 1 GB DDR3 is doing its work quite effectively. - Instant upgrade to 4.4.2 Kitkat is icing on the cake. You will also get future updates. - Played NOVA 3, Riptide GP2 on this one. Absolute beauty. You will love this tab for how it handles graphics. - Battery is good. The initial charge was quick & also the drain :) but evventually the battery started behaving normally with 2-2.5 hrs to recharge & good backup of atleaes a day with moderate to heavy use. - Very portable. One hand grip is perfect. also, the screen orientation for portrait to landscape is flawless, even in the home screen. - Rubberized perforated back is good to hold & gives a premium feel. - Those who are looking for storage, buy the 32 GB as you will get 28.5 free space available. And remember this is a tablet & not a laptop ;) - 3G was not my requirement. In case you need to use net on the go, use your smartphone as a WiFi Hotspot. You are good to go. Cons - - I couldn't find this product in local market. Had to use Flipkart instead. Even the accessories were not available. Used eBay to order a cover & screen guard. - Not sure about ASUS service in NCR region. Final Verdict - an absolute beauty at this price range. Won't disappoint you in performance/looks/handling/android updates/portability/backup etc etc... The list goes on n on as I use it further ;) Enjoy!!
As usual Flipkart service was very fast and good.... About Tablet - awesome tablet till now...... NO cons. my view about the processor is that its very fast with 1.2 GHz Quad core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor with 1 GB RAM..... HD display with very good viewing angles.... Front 1.2 MP camera for online chatting..... 32 GB inbuilt memory so no worries about heavy graphics intensive games and runs without any lags..... I dont care about real camera because I own a DSLR camera..... And most imp. it supports OTG without ROOT.... I'm using USB keyboard and mouse + Pendrives.....I'm using this tablet for my office use instead of bulky laptops.... U can go for it....
Back in November 2013 I bought this product from flipkart with a reasonable price. It's my 2nd tablet,former Galaxy Tab 2 P3100. Here are some experience of mine hope this'll help you to judge before buy this product. The first thing I would say about this is The best of Google in a tablet with a decent price offer from Flipkart.If you are in a tight budget then there is no better option except this. Powered by Nvidia Tegra 3 processor with 4+1 core coupled with 1Gigs of RAM which is more than enough for multitasking and gaming purpose. You can play all high end games without any issue. Good battery life and protected by a Gorilla Glass to save your money from buying a screen guard. Decent resolution with 217ppi density to display a sharp quality of picture. thanks to Google for it's Kitkat update and thanks to Flipkart and WS retail for brought this Product to us.
very gud experience with flipkart thumbsup to flipkart service, the tab is much effective very gud sleek design no heat problemz, gud graphics very gud audio output battery iam not sure of it hope it wud last for a day for heavy usage
The tablet is amazing in this price range, Absolutely no complaints. Works like a dream...very smooth interface. Got delivered within 2 days.
still the best tab around this price..!!! just go for it. godd for reading ebooks watching games..awesome gaming anything will run on it..u just say and it ll run onit why not it is a nvidea tegra 3 quad core processor which has a unique core processing to save battery when it is not needed..scratch resistant..and yes its NEXUS so u get first updates if android so close u eyes and just buy it
It is almost a month now I am using Google Nexus 7 - 32 GB 2012 Tablet. Pros: - For a price of Rs.11 K the Tablet is very good. The quality of material used is too good. Cons: - The charging cable is too short in length Kudos to Flipkart for the ontime delivery and very good packaging. Keep up the good work!

Good product...upgradeable to 4.4.2... Best tab to buy ...best for gaming and reading...Thanks FlipKart
I really was impressed really by the packaging and all those stuff from flipkart first and foremost. And then after I stripped everything off I just was amazed to see the thing at my palms... A SLENDER PERFECTLY DESIGNED MARVEL AT A STEAL OF A PRICE.... as others have reviewed earlier I see no difference from what most of them have experienced before. It really packs a deathstrike punch for what it offers. Glossy looks, Scratch resistant, Crisp sharp display, Powerful processor, Smooth performance and all that... you name it it does it... Buy of the decade easily. Its a trend setter in every sense of imagination for what it does.
This is my second nexus device that I buy from Flipkart.. feels solid and portable.. great for reading books and playing games also watching hd videos was simply fun. definite buy!
Product is too good. My mom is using this product and find it very easy to operate. Mainly we use for playing games, videos, songs. Nice packaging. Super fast delivery.
first kudos to flipkart for ultra fast delivery. second, about the tablet. it sure is one of the best budget tablet and the purest android experience makes it more enjoyable. simplicity is its trademark and is sure not feel outdated from any angle inside and out. go for it.
After couple of months this will not start i.e, not boot. Same happened with my friend also. If you want to buy then you have to take care of battery, as soon as it is 20% charge it. Once it's shutdown you should be lucky to so that it starts working again. And I was not lucky
Absolutely useless piece of hardware at exorbitant cost. There are much better tabs available at lower cost. The price is too high for outdated hardware.
About flipkart: -------------------- good packaging and fast delivery to say the least. Delivered in 2 days. About the product: -------------------------- Pros: Good pricing Vanilla Android and quick updates Awesome developer support USB OTG (with root) HD resolution screen (1280 * 800 pixels) Good battery stand-by Good gaming experience Cons: A washed out display (problem with all Nexus 7 2012) Connectivity (No wi-fi direct & cannot transfer stuff via bluetooth, other than multi-media files) Sunlight legibility The way I see it, you just cannot get a better product at this price point. This tablet is bloody smooth.
I bought the Asus Google Nexus 7 2012 32GB Wi-Fi edition nearly a month ago. Main reason to buy this particular tablet being stock AOSP UI, latest firmware (4.4.2) and the ability to install custom ROMs and finally Ubuntu Touch support. Overall a pretty good 7" tablet in 10K range
EXCELLENT DISPLAY ZIPPY PROCESSOR EASY TO USE FAST UPGRADES..etc etc etc etc etc etc just go for it guys :P
With the price being just 11k. it is a tablet worth buying. I had some problem with the first tablet I had, but flipkart was very prompt in replacing the same with a new one and now this new one hasn't given me any problem. Just go for it.
The product is as mentioned. There are no flaws as far as I have used. My mom is really happy with the device (except for the heaviness she feels after using it for more than 1 hr) The device's bottom section heats up after prolonged usage. Apart from that, I recommend it to anyone who wants an alternate for playing and app using tablet
I have taken this product recently, it looks like it's good product. battery and other stuff are good as well, only thing that sometime I missed like there is no SIM card option , so we have to depend on WI-FI network only.
Great for reading and watching movie also you can play games. Its little heavy also the back get hot when you play games
nice product but faced issues with battery back-up and flipkart has E-techies...who are incompetent to troubleshoot for hardware issues by askng to factory restore for battery issues.... that was funny... and flipkart never able to fox the issue... if someone wants to buy a product and be stuck with it if any issues are there.... then buy from flipkart...
I like Product description is very good I like it very much, i will try to get it back after some time, I will give it five out of five marks as symbol of feedback, many many thanks fizzkart thanks
2012 model was cheaper, but not much different from 2013. So basically, a good value for money. Personally, I think Google Nexus is pretty cool if you are not a blind Apple fan. I would any day buy this over a I Pad or I Pad Mini.
finally my wait is over. thanks flikart for the wow service as always. apart from front cam and sim support, its best in class. what more you expect within 10K(16g). pretty much happy and enjoying. the only concern i have about this product as what technique should i use to configure m Dongle with this. tried hell lot of option to get it configued like. SuperSU, superuser. nothing seems to be working. for pendrive PPP seems to be working. Any idea guys. plese revert me with suggestion. thanks.
This is one of the best Tab in the Market comparable to I pad mini. Impressive performance and usability.
I have been using this tab for last 6 months and it is working more than expected. I have been playing and also finished some like NFS,GTA,Asphalt,Carmegddon,Earn to Die and many more games. If your looking for an ultimate tab and at a good price,then go for this one. I am assured that this nexus 2012 is an ultimate winner in his class in his time.
The best tab you can ever buy. No second thoughts for buying this. Bought this and fell in love. Instant upgrade to KITKAT 4.4.2 soon after connecting to wifi. Five stars
I bought nexus 7 one month back. Updated it to 4.4 KitKat. The performance of the tablet is impressive.apps run smooth. Very less lag. Some of the problems I noticed while using it is it does not allow apk files to share over Bluetooth or wifi direct. No file sharing is possible over WiFi direct. So connectivity is not good on this tablet. Only Bluetooth works for sharing which is very slow. All the apps and games run smooth. No rear camera is a problem at this price. Battery backup is good but not up to the mark. It give 4+ hours of screen on time. No built in application for reading pen drive. So you have to buy an app forrs 200 for using otg on this. No dongle support is a headache on this device. Other than that all things are good.
If you are for a tablet within 15k then you should seriously consider this tablet ! Pure android , regular updates, good build quality:)
Ho Just brought a Nexus 7 from Flipkart The piece is not switching on , charged for 7 hrs still not working Called Flipkart service at 3 pm today they promised to call back no answer Poor Customer service- called again they promised to call back in 24 hrs -Where is the famed Flipkart service -Daughter Bday and have a dud Nexus 7 thanks to Flipkart
Firstly, thank you Flipkart for the excellent-as-always service. The Nexus: I was torn between the Lenovo A3000 and the discounted Nexus 7 2012. It's been about a month i've had this now. I'm not still completely over the A3000. I'll buy it if i have some extra money later. I went for the Nexus on account of the differences in processor and display. Con? The Nexus automatically downloads the latest Android, whenever connected to the Net. This can't be disabled or delayed. I spent about 700Mb of my 3g data plan while it upgraded from 4.2.2 (pre-installed) to 4.3 (or was it 4.4?), and then to 4.4.2. Only after these upgrades could i begin using the device in earnest. But i forgive this behaviour, though, as being a price to pay for free Android upgrades. Another con perhaps? The 3.5mm audio port is a "headphone" port, i.e. audio-out. It is not a "headset" port. It cannot take in mic input from a headset. So while on a Skype call, for instance, you can listen to the other party's audio via headphones. But when you speak, your voice has to be captured by the in-built mics. They are pretty sensitive, so you don't have to speak too loud, and can maintain reasonable privacy. But it felt bad to miss out on this (basic?) feature all the same. After the Kitkat upgrade, i was able to use the Nexus Media Importer (the paid version) and an OTG cable, and use my USB flash media. Considering that with earlier versions of Android, this was only possible with rooting, this was a good plus point. I only use the device for light weight Net browsing and book-reading. The rest of the family uses it for watching nursery rhymes and cartoons and Skype. So at the moment i'm happy with it, though as i mentioned, not really ecstatic about it. But again, thank you, Flipkart.
Hi, Anyone using this tab can u please tell me whether this Tab Support USB datacard for internet browsing??
This is best one in 10K range. I am using it from last one month and didn't find any issue yet. Battery backup and performance is also good. Got delivered in good condition from flipkart and extremely satisfied with my decision to go for it.
Please note that although I have a 16GB unit, as per the reviewers' comments received earlier, tried installing Paid application "Nexus Media Importer " for reading / playing contents from a Memory stick thru' OTG cable....Must say it was very good. Hence without rooting, just by paying ~200 bucks, we can utilise this application for interfacing with a Memory stick.
Bought this for my grandparents for mostly offline multimedia use, skype and games. Experience has been good so far. Drawback is mostly the battery life. I wish it gave longer standby time.
It has been 15 days since I bought this product. I felt this is worth the money spent. If budget is tight and if we keep the 3G aside then go for this..
Had a hard time choosing between nexus 7 2012 and 2013 and ultimately bought this one. Well nexus 7 2013 is no doubt better than 2012 but the question is..is it worth the extra money(around 10k extra). The only advantage that 2013 has over 2012 is the screen resolution. Yes the processor too but not a big difference. I am glad I opted for 2012 over 2013. Service was excellent.
Hi friends, 1 week back i purchased Google Nexus 7 2012 with 32 gb from flipkart for Rs. 11,500. Its a good tablet and best for gaming . This 7 inch tablet is good for gaming. I have played ASPHALT 8, REAL RACING 3, NFS MOST WANTED and many games. Its a good tablet and happily can purchased. Good The best thing in Nexus Tabs or Phones is updating the software is available Working Good & delivery is fast. Bad No Slim card, no expandable memory card, camera is normal, regards, Chiluka Srinivas Rao, Hayathnagar, Hyderabad.
I have been using this tab for nearly a month now. I use it mostly for reading, videos, music, rounds of crushing candies and communication purposes. Battery is good. I have heard about charging issues, but touch wood, nothing I faced yet. And I hope it continues to be so, knock on wood. Have seen Skype crash once in 20 times. But not sure who's the culprit. Strong built has also been tested twice. Front camera suffices for its duties towards me. I am a little skeptic about how microphone performs. The two mic points have been average so far. Comfortable grip. Very clear speaker. Audio output is great too. At times while multitasking, play music hangs in between, producing noise, hurting my ears. Else, all other apps work just fine. Haven't seen no lags, hangs or crashes than the ones mentioned. Summing up, I'm satisfied!
Really happy to use this awesome tablet. So far everything is good. I am surprised that how Google can sell such a quality tablet for this price range! We cannot get anything else as BEST as this. A real value for money tablet. Pros: 1. Price - wow 2. Build quality - super 3. Battery - good 4. Performance - super 5. Hardware utilization/optimization - wow Cons: (not really much) 1. Heating, while on wifi - usual with many tablets and smart phones 2. Size/Thickness - not bad, but could be better 3. Nothing To be frank, I can easily list PROS, but struggled to think about CONS. I think that make you understand the power of this Nexus 7. If you have plans to buy tablet between 15,000 to 25,000, you can happily go for it. Worth investment, without any second thoughts... Happy buyer...
Excellent product for the stated price! Gr8 screen resolution and touch sensitivity! Definitely recommended product.
Excellent tab with a very good battery life and a very decent price. Worth a buy instead of any budget tablet.
It is just superb at a superb price. Good quality, no lags, and just everything u can imagine :) Best part was the delivery time by Flipkart.
The best thing in Nexus Tabs or Phones is updating the software is much easier... Thanks for the best pricing.. WS Retail.. Working Good. Good to use. Delivery was quick. Happy!
Asus Nexus 1st gen. tab is amazing. Comfortable to hold, comparatively light weight & slim. Many pros here, but the issue I am facing with this tablet is its slow charging. Initially the tablet charging was smooth, but after about 20 days the tablet charged dead slow (5 to 7 % per hour). I read online many reviews globally for solution, but to my surprise there is no solution to this yet & many people are facing similar issues. Although sometimes it charges smoothly but its very annoying most of the times, also the battery drops while charging if the tablet is active. Overall the tablet is excellent apart from this annoying charging problem. I would have definitely rated it a 5 star, but wont due to the charging problem. Again the Flipkart service is up to mark. WS retail is the best!
Awesome tablet; good for gaming too Just feeling alive after a long while playing , great graphics WORTH BUYING
Very nice tablet it's value for money awsome performance it has very nice build quality upgradeable to kitkat 4.4.2 the only drawback is that it does not have back camera
As i had expected, Google Nexus 7 is one of the better tablets in the market. Buy without any hesitation for you wont be disappointed at all. Pros: Perfect size, large enough for watching movies, small enough to be held comfortably. Impressive battery backup, i charge mine once every two-three days with moderate usage. Play Store! Android Openness. Cons: Occasional Android performance lags. No sim card slot (but i guess if you decide to buy it, doesn't really matter for you) Overall, a nice robust tablet available at amazing price!!
Good product coupled with good service and makes the customer delight. Absolutely loving the tablet.
Pros: Good design and build quality Fast for a average user Tested Games like Asphalt - Runs decently Cons Battery lasts for about 2 - 3 hrs under heavy gaming
I had been thinking of buying this NEXUS from past couple of months and finally one day decided to click on Buy Now button. So far a good experience with this Tab. Got upgadded to latesr KitKat OS after initial setup. I will use it for next couple of weeks and will give a full review on the my experience on NEXUS 7...
Its performance is simply wonderful.The display quality is awesome especially considering its price tag. the Android got automatically updated to its latest version kitkat within a matter of days.Reading books on 7" screen is a pleasure after choosing "Sepia" or " night" mode. The processor is reasonably fast.The Hangout or Skype work fine.
The pros: The touch is very smooth, it does not hang, & thanks to the processor heavy applications also play effectively. The major negative I felt was that it is missing the back camera due to which clicking photos is not an option. Secondly there is no slot for a sim card, so you need to be in a wifi zone to access the internet. In the given price it is a good buy especially if you are looking for a good processor.
This us unbelievable. Flipkart delivered by with in One Day. This is awesome. Keep it up Flipkart. And also this is really great tablet with 11K range. My kid is enjoying a lot. lot many futures. what else you expect with this price range..... ?
Great product from Asus. Except for lack of Good cover in market, everything about. Nexus 7 is good..
Thank you Flipkart for your amazing service. I got the product within 2 days of my order. You guys rock. I have been using this product since 1 week and am really impressed by the speed and fluidity of this tablet. 1. The first thing you will notice is the display. Its simply amazing with 1280X800 pixels concentrated in 7'. The text, images, HD videos all look delightful not to forget, its gorilla glass. 2. Got updated to Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat) right after I connected to my WIFI. The entire over the air update was smooth and without any glitch and finished within an hour. 3. Temple Run 2, Subway Surfers, Asphalt 8 or anything runs perfectly smooth. Surprisingly I found Wordament from my Windows Phone to my absolute delight. 4. Battery life is between 6 to 7 hours on moderate usage and 3 to 4 hours on heavy usage. I could go for an entire day with a single charge with casual mail checks and Facebook browsing. 5. No heating issues or any kind of lag noticed so far. 6. At Rs.9500/- its definitely the best tablet in the market with Quadcore processor, 1 Gb Ram, 16 Gb memory and a stunning HD display. However few things may sound a deal breaker for some. 1. Only WIFI version available now. That's not much of an issue, as most people have a smartphone with them and they can always share their phone's internet with the Nexus 7. 2. No rear camera available. I don't need it anyway. Totally in love with this product. Get one, before a smarter one gets it.
I have done a very big mistake buying this nexus 7 (2012 version) few months ago. Please don't buy this product, there is a problem with the touch glass (not LCD). It will break at anytime even without any mishandling (it is very delicate). Usually you will see cracks developed at the corners at starting and they may creep to the centre, bringing the LCD malfunction finally. Flipkart anyway doesn't give any warranty for this, even ASUS or Google nexus also say this is not covered under warranty. For my surprise the ASUS authorised service centres in bangalore are charging exactly Rs.9500 , just for this touch screen glass, which more than the Nexus 7/16GB total device.I have seen many complaints with this touch glass breaking problem. Better you go for Kindle fire, although it is 1 or 2 thousands more.
very nice TAB....preety decent battery, screen resolution is also good compared to other TABs No problem while playing big size games...
I have no words to xplain my joy to be a proud owner of such a great tablet in just Rs 10999/- . The credit goes to flipkart and google-asus combination. Battery, Display, Browsing performance, Gaming, Handiness, Looks everything is in the double positive side. Real combination of Value for money, Performance, Brand, Technology and above all Satisfaction without a single regret. If u r searching for a tab without call facilities then THIS IS IT . Feel the best .......
The product is good, clarity wise, speed wise. But prefer a sim version in the same model. Internet usuage is also pretty fine to use. This is the cheaper one I belive which has good features
Pros: Feather smooth, no hanging, HD display, long battery life, good for games n movies Neg: no data except WiFi, no otg option
Great product with great delivery. You can definitely go for this if you are looking for a table (without calling facility)
I dont play much games but use the tab for reading digital books and magazine, do surfing and listen to the music etc... watch vidoes as well... It has become a must have for me now.... i really think its great value for money!
I really bought this for experimenting with some android roms and just general PDF viewing. As far as the product goes in concern, it does have a teeeeny bit of lag in the UI as compared to the nexus 4 or nexus 5 but nothing severe as often seen on flagship samsung phones. Oh and being a nexus, I immediately got the 4.4.2 update after the initial setup of the device right of of the box! One downside though is the it lacks the rear camera, but that was not a deal breaker for me. If you are looking for a tablet in this price range, I would suggest this one for sure!
So I bought this from Flipkart , got delivered in 3 days ( BTW i live in Kerala ) . The tablet itself is probably the best you can get at this price . Pros: -Awesome battery life , lasts days if you stick to light weight duties like music and net browsing . -Mind blowing processing power , i play really graphics heavy 3D games like NFS Most Wanted and Asphalt and the graphics looks as good as in a low end PC ! -Space ..... 32 GB , need i say more ?? after I've loaded everything i need I've still got 5 GB left ... Cons - A little heavy , arms could get tired after a while holding it for long periods of time - Charging take a while , but that might be due to the big fat 4325mAh battery - Might get addicted to mobile 3D gaming .... lol
I am using this tablet for some months now. It has an absolute smooth and fluidic operation. A good vibrant display. Has not given any problem. I have played some demanding games without any lagging. The only drawback is that it does not have expandable memory otherwise it deserved full 5 stars in its category and at this price point.
purchased 2 of them on flipkart. both turned up DOA !!!! ASUS/GOOGLE standards of QA !!! flipkart took back and refunded the money on the wallet. settled for the micromax p650. thats worth the buy.
I have used only 4 days. pros Good display Good finish very good speed good sound quality cons 1) Without internet the device is of no use. 2) No otg cable is included with the product. 3) I dont like the added security (you can't share apps through bluetooth) 4) i want to disable all the graphics and animations to increase the battery. But i can't find a solution. 5) No sim card slot. I am not bothered about this feature before purchasing the device but as using i cant find a wifi hotspot everywhere in India. 6) A number of unwanted apps are installed in the tab which i will not use at least for once in my life. 7) Full hd .mkv files cannot be played. Verdict This tab is best for them who need a tab to read eBooks, play games,listen music,and watch standard quality video. Not for them who need internet everywhere with the tablet.
This is my sister's birthday gift and she loves playing games on it. Even I use this to play HD Games and they run very fluently with any lag. Battery is very good and good enough to HD play games for a long duration. I thought that 1GB of RAM would be less for handling my heavy games but this tablet proved me wrong because of Nvidia Tegra 3. I updated my Nexus to Android 4.4.2[Kitkat] and its simply awesome.
I am very happy with the product , delivers what it says. Most of the games rum smoothly. The only con i think is connectivity but it is offset by great experience of hardware and software, can't get my hands off it. :) Although i am finding it difficult to locate a good cover for it :P
Nexus 7 (2012 - 32GB) is a great product to own. Battery life is awesome. Speaker is not very good (very low volume). Automatic android update is an added advantage. Worth every penny.
It is very nice. The processing speed is very good. I recommended it for gaming. Asphalt 8 runs so smoothly. the size is more than 1 GB.
I think this is one of the best tabs one can buy on a tight budget. Highly recommended at the Flipkart Price.
awesome device ! i bought my nexus 7 from flipkart and its an amazing device that you can buy for such a low price. no other tablet compares to the specifications and features of this tablet upto the price range of Rs25k. i would say if u are looking to purchas.e a tab upto 15000 , just grab the deal ,,,, dont give a second thought!!!! PS.- i upgraded to KITKAT 4.4.2 the next day i recieved it. :)
Shipped my order very soon and the delivery was also very quick. Happy with the transaction, recommended seller.
Very good tab... Flipkart delivery was great.... Packing was good.... This is my first tab and i beleive this is one of the best tabs... The only drawback is lack of camera.. except that all are very fine...
The Galaxy Nexus 7 Tab is an awesome device in many ways. I got the Google nexus 7 few days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Its features are: * Best for gaming *Preety good screen resolution *Excellent Processor *Latest versions of ANDROID *1 GB DDR3 RAM
Given the obsession with "Apple" the Asus Nexus 7 makes its mark in the Tablet industry. It offers almost everything the iPads do and maybe even more. It is extremely user friendly. It's upgradable to the 4.4 kitkat OS. The battery life is excellent. The sound quality and picture quality is great if you're looking to watch films on it. In the tablet market I rank this as #1. The only reason why I gave it 4/5 and not a full star rating is because it doesn't have a rear camera. It would be nice to have a camera. That would make it a full package.
But while using the Tablet, there is absolutely no reminder that the product is a year old. Absolutely none. The tablet is mind blowing and with some good combination of schemes only cost me 9900 bucks. I don't generally write reviews, but this is a special exception cause the product is amazing. Also, I got some apps for discount on Christmas. NFS Most Wanted runs like a dream and other display requirements from the Tab are amazing.
After a lot of reserach on what to buy . i finally zeroed down on the google nexus tab. it is really nice product except for the fact that there is not back camera available. Overall the performance is very good. At this price the product is extremely good and worth the price.
The delivery was fast and the product I purchased was Nexus 7 2012 32gb . No problems with products and the shipment. I was not at home at the time when product was recieved , I jus knw that it has defect free and as described. I will be reviewing this product soon when I ll use it!
I bought this masterpiece of tabs 10 days back from flipkart.And to note i really appreciate their service which was delivered in 3 days. I had to say this beats galaxy tabs by margin and stands at same height as ipad mini. Its a pure android experience.things i really liked about it. 1.Great batterylife. 2.Ability to run almost 25 apps without lag. 3.Great gaming experience like nothing else 4.Clearest of HD playback for movie buffs.I fell in love with the device for this!! 5.Support by a maturing Google playstore.But here apple beats it handdown. 6.Pricing at 10999 for 32gb when i bought makes it a steal deal. Cons: 1.Gets heated after 2hrs of gaming.(playing Temple run) 2.Cannot play NFS Most wanted. 3.To use Pendrive,need to buy nexus media importer app. 4.Dependency on Wi-fi . But overall go n buy before they stick a out of order caption.It will be a device that u will fall in love with!!! Enjoy comparing this with ur friends who own Galaxy tabs and ipads and show them how they made fool of themselves. Nexus 7-U Rock!!
I am very much satisfied with the WS retail as i m looking forward to do much shopping in ws retail. packing, quality of the product, timely delivery.. every aspect deserves 5* rating
It was easy for me to search the product on Flipkart online and ordered it.Nexus 7 tablet is good tablet presently running in market.The tablet was well packed and received at expected time by Flipkart.
I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Now coming to the product, Since this is a google product. There is no need to wait for updates. As we know updates are really essential in getting the maximum performance of your device. As soon as i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The device is now more smoother than previous jelly bean version. The 4325 mah Battery easily last for a day with a usage of 6hrs+ screen on time Which includes gaming and HD movie playback.
This is a perfect first Tab for my parents - easy to use, lightweight and very handy! they are more than excited and happy in using the Nexus Tab!
Nexus 7.....Only Name is Enough Its pure Google I recieved it within one day of my order thanks to In a day gurantee.Nexus 7 was runnig android 4,2,2 Jellybean out of box but within 2 hrs it has upgraded to Android 4.4.2 Kitkat.
Been using this product for over a month now Had the best android experience so far Best for a typical android user Runs games without lags, Plays movies in HD Sharp screen for reading purposes Great Battery Life It is value for money. Note: Guys if u face problems with the battery (screen flicker, refusing to boot, etc) all u hv to do is open up the back cover (doesnt void warranty!) remove the battery socket and slide it back in. there are tutorials on youtube to do so.
Best in class tablet and got really good offer form flipkart... Happy with both the product and service. I haven't used the tablet much since it is relatively new.. But battery is really excellent watching movies back to back the juice runs at least 6 - 7 hours ease with Wi-Fi on. Picture clarity and sound is good. Playing games in tab is all together a different experience. In simple words Value for Money.... Worth it!...
seems to be flawlessly fast and 32GB is enough space for basic tasks, apps and games.Only downside being the battery which seems to be little under power class .
best tablet at this price point..HD screen and NVIDIA QUAD CORE processor...32 GB...What else do u expect...... ...simply the best u can get.
This is the fourth Google Nexus 7 , I have purchased for my family members ! Hats off to Google nexus & off course Flipkart
I was looking for a tablet with quad core processor and at-least 1 GB ram with a good brand name . I found all of them in Nexus 7 32 gb . Amazing performance (9 / 10 or 10 / 10) ., touch response is very smooth (10 / 10 ) ., Superb screen resolution and color quality ( 10 / 10) . It gives you 32 gb inbuilt memory . so no need to buy extra SD cards . Its lacking inbuilt 3g sim slot or external dongle support .. it was not a problem for me because I have a smart phone can I can easily tether WIFI or create WIFI hotspot from my phone and access internet in my Nexus 7 on the go .So no need to buy different internet plans for both mobile and tablet . Build quality is superb and looks very nice . One thing I would like to mention is the battery life .. its just above average . 5 to 6 hours under heavy usage like watching videos or hd gaming and more than 10 hours of browsing and other usage . Its been 20 days since I am using this tablet and I haven't found any cons . I would recommend every one to buy this tablet with confidence
FlipKart service is the beat for the fastest delivery and genuine product.Its a value for money tablet if you are searching for only tablet purposes.(No Camera / No 3G)

Very nice product and amazing experience and no lag in the videos. Best product if you don't look for Camera and Phone calls. Battery Backup is average(1 day if not used). Takes more time to charge. Movies ( 4-6 hrs), Games (5-6 hrs). I notified WiFi signal strength problems. If you are crazy about Nexus , go for nexus 2013 version. Overall my purpose is for reading, games and movies. I'm satisfied with this product and thanks to Flip kart for Quick delivery!
Pros 1. Value for money is unmatchable, no othe tablet comes close. 2. Performance of quad core processor with 1 GB of RAM is amazing 3. Game rendering is acceptable and do not lags. 4. Speakers are loud and clear 5. The screen is Full HD and very bright 6. Latest updates will be available sooner than any other device. Cons 1. Battery dies with 9 hours of constant usage 2. Wifi antenna is bit weak in reception(one will not notice any difference) 3. Charger cable is very short in length, bedtime videos while charging will be difficult excersie.
Bought the nexus 7 from flipkart. Very quick and prompt delivery by flipkart. Nexus 7 is the best buy you could make if you need to only read books and are not highly into gaming.
Its the best tab you will get in this price range. Loaded with the stock os from Google it has been a delightful experience with its butter smooth touch. The tab is loaded with Android 4.2 but you can upgrade it to 4.3 & then to latest version 4.4 Kitkat. You can compare it with Dell Venue 7 which has better specifications but has performance issues including poor battery life.(Check online reviews) The only downside is that the front camera is not enabled for personal use;You will have to download the camera launcher app from the playstore. Buy this & you won't regret.
All I was looking for, best in class. Display perfect. android perfect with latest kit kat. All there that's required and must have feature of a tablet. one lack could -be no sim slot thus a no calling tab but would be able to accept wifi hotspot internet.
Used it for 2 days and till now the experience is good. Till now the gaming experience is just magnificent will be giving more updates in future.
Good product. Latest pure android experience. Million apps and extremely affordable. Delivered about two days late. But, worth the wait!
Good Things - 1. Stunning display 2. Good storage space (mine one is 32 GB) 3. Good sound (especially while playing apps like guitar which gives feeling of playing actual guitar) 4. Multitasking is great. My kid gives it a hard time opening videos, games, apps and net without closing earlier ones and it still survives with same speed and performance. 5. Upgrades are supported on the device - asked for upgrade to 4.3 jelly bean on device start. After 2 days was again upgraded to Kitkat 4.4.2 (latest kitkat). That was kind of good surprise. Not happy about - 1. Heats up while playing games (candy crush, little commander, epic, Mau mau etc...). 2. The auto rotate (vertical to horizontal and reversal) does not always work especially for videos. 3. There's nothing special in Kitkat OS for tablets, so apart from icons and black background change didn't discover anything special. I was happy with the jelly bean on my tablet. and the kitkat did slowed down the booting process to about 20/25 secs. I was expecting otherwise. Jelly bean was good at 12/15 secs...
Since this is a 2012 model, there is nothing more to add to the already hundreds of reviews on youtube. My 2 cents.. PROS 1.Amazing value for money .Google tab for under 10k for 32GB 2.Good screen for reading and multimedia alike. 3.Portable and light weight. 4.On the air Google Software updates. CONS 1.Battery life is just around 5 hours with multimedia usage. 2.Speakers are located behind the screen.Not a very good design. 3.Camera is just sufficient for Video calls. Chat videos appear grainy under normal room lighting.
what else can you get for 11k? hd display, awesome sound, 32gb space very handy and very useful. thaks to flipkart.
I got one a week back. But it had some issues with the display. When the device is rotated to landscape mode, the top edge of the screen shows some sort of distortions. After the rotation is completed the screen is back to normal.Got the tab replaced today. The new tab I got I thought is free from the distortion problem. Tab was perfectly fine and showed no sort of issues. Then I updated the tab to the latest 4.4.2 version. Now it has started to show the same issues which the previous tab was showing. I dont know whether the 4.4.2 is the culprit. Other N7 buyers pls help me. Pls check you device and see if u are facing the same issue. My email id is : meonline2013@gmail.com Pls send me an email. I shall tell you when exactly this issue is visible along with pictures.
its the best tab in 10 k value for money its run very fast an smooth without any lag cpu is fast gpu gives console level gaming with its 12 core i battery saver core
Build quality 4/5 Processor/Performance 3.5/5 - tegra 3 with 12 core GPU Features 3/5 - no rear camera, no memory card but there is OTG support Value/Price 4/5 - 12k for 32GB space/ casual gaming/ fast OTA updates/multipurpose one gripe is that there is no proximity sensor -so if you use a case that is not specifically designed (magnet present) OVERALL RATING 3.6/5
Great product. Quality is outstanding for the price.Does everything a tablet should. It is pure google - fast and smooth. One can be also be assured of upgrades for the next two years.
got this tablet for 11K. delivery was on time as usual from flipkart. this tablet from google is really value for money. great hardware specifications from google/asus as it plays all heavy games. one of the best benefit of owning a google product is that very first day i used it, it updated itself to most recent version of android ie Kitkat. I'm happy to have it.. thanks..:)
Shipped quickly, in fact the same day. Arrived quite fast, faster than I thought it would. It was nicely packed, and arrived without any defects.
Its an amazing product for an affordable price. Sleek design, handy and fast, super fast. The time i configured the device and enabled wifi, the first thing it got itself updated to KiKat, the latest OS from andriod. Resolution is superb. Speakers are good enough. Battery Life for me on WiFi - 10+ hours Game experience is amazing. Skype Video Calling works fantastic.
An exceptional gaming experience in this price range of under 12k for an amazing 7 inch screen. There is no negative point in Nexus7. It is designed to not to support the SIM cards/ MicroSD cards, so that is surely not a negative point for this tab. Do not go for this tablet, if: -> you want to make phone with the tab. OR . if you are looking for 2g/3g SIM/dongle connectivity, don't go for this one. -> you are looking for a good camera tab and want to take photos and record videos Certainly go for this tab, if: -> looking for a wifi only tab -> play high end games. I've tested the games like Subway surf, temple run, speed racing and the high end games like asphalt and riptide etc runs just flawless on this. -> play HD videos and movies -> very good battery backup Additionally, also make a note when you are deciding to buy your tab that: internal 32GB storage is anytime better than an internal 8GB + 32GB microSD. Internal 32GB is going to be quite faster. I received this 32GB tab from Flipkart in Jan, 2014 and so far it's working superb without any complaint. Enjoy!
I got this for my mom. Its the best thing available in this price range... and i did not regret buying this. Only shortcoming is that it doesn't have expandable memory... but then my mom wouldn't need that.. she just wants to do some internet which is available at home with wifi.. It is a good purchase.. i recommend it.. specially if its a gift for an elederly person.
Just brought this product yesterday.....it's really awesome...got 4.4.2 kitkat update automatically.....it's just lag free.....best budjet tab at about 11k..i highly recommend this product.
awesome tab.. agreed its the older version, but nevertheless its very good.. have no second thoughts about it.. flipkart has managed to sell this at even cheaper rates than what I had brought them for- so do not miss this opportunity!!!!
This is a good Tab, will work for most of the utilities well except high end gaming. If you want a non 3g Tablet primarily for surfing, reading, mails, office etc. it will suffice all the needs. It is only when you are playing heavy games, you feel the lack of RAM.
best performance easy google o.s update..my tab is now with 4.4.2 android....when purchased a few days ago it was 4.2 android..no need to go to service centre for o.s update...con.no back camera and file transfer from laptop to tab creates a little bit problem...
I am using this tablet for a month now. These are very frank views from a person who loves gadgets: Pros good price and quick updates available. features nice 7 inch tablet 1 GB ram does good for daily needs its a good tablet for gifting it to person who doesn't use many apps on the tab the screen is not that good, images are pixelated but hd movies play clearly. the battery lasts for a day now i am just using it as a social networking tablet all my heavy duty apps are used on my other phone overall good tablet to be used for reading purposes and watching hd movies, ITS a no no for games.
very nice tablet . writing the review after one month use. all game running smoothly. no hang and no lag. clear display.720 p video running with MX Player and BS player smoothly. all video format support like MKV, MP4 and others.battery backup is good not better.if heavy used then backup of battery around 7 hours.so it is good for me.camera is also good , not up to the mark. video calling through Skype is good.nice product from asus.Filpkart service is very good, on the second day i got the tablet.
It's very good...included all necessary features for reasonable good prize Looking for updated Only drawback will be the camera part Needs to be reviewed we extensively
Very good service from flipkart. awesome as usual. Product is very good. Pros:- Very good display. Very good processor to play games. Cons:- Battery backup while on wifi is a little less. But for this price, no doubt, it is overall superb. I have used it for last few weeks.
if u are looking to buy the tab other than for calling... its d best one u can find.. with its best features and technology u wont regret with the new version coming in of nexus 7 coming in, it is still d best tab for d budget range..
Fist about FLIPKART. Excellent work guys and thanks for your support. and the product deliveries are always fast. Now bout the tab. It is nice good looking. Fast? Not so much as compared to Nexus 7 2013. Display is good not best but better than ipad mini. the internal storage is awesome to hold all yor data, big games, I played Asphalt Airborne on this but the graphics r not so good and it lags a little bit. So its certain Nexus 7 2012 is not for high end gaming. So its better to buy 2013 version. I know its very costly buy hey you wont need to worry after that for a year at least. Ups: Bright big Screen with good ppi in market Large storage. Good battery Backup. easy to hold in both Hands downs. No camera on back. Useful if you use facebook much, like me. Front cam good for Skype though. Little Heavy. 340 Grams. No headphones are given. But that is not an issue. Storage not upgrade-able. But you wont need that in 32 GB Version. No sim card? But here is a solution>> If you had a Android phone like galaxy S3 you can turn it into a wifi hotspot. So dont waste money on dongle. or if u wanan buy dongle but a wifi dongle instead. Well the product is awesome after all enjoy it for this price tag.
this tablet is all about entertainment. 1. Long Battery Life , even on latest 4.4 KITKAT version it lasts a day. 2. Butter smooth HD IPS touch screen. 3. works efficiently, 15-20 tabs runs in background and still works without any lag. Cons: no local service center.
Wonderful budget tablet....excellent for viewing movies and and reading ebooks apart from access to other apps and games. Since this tablet is in a way Google's in-house product, the software can be updated to its latest version soon after Google's announcement....thus I have been able to update the OS to Android 4.4.2 version....something that is not possible for other android tablets so soon ! With a solid build and great sleek finish it is a pleasure to hold the tablet in hand. The only negative thing that I may mention is that its battery might have been a little more more powerful. However access to the entire Google eco-system through this tablet is an exciting experience and more than makes up for this shortcoming.
It's been more than a month I am using this tablet, loved the product all these days. It's nice set of functions at that rate. Display, functioning speed, I am happy with this.
very much satisfied with this product. i was also allowed to upgrade android to kitkat 4, that was very good with this product.
this tab is just awesome with never disappointing service the nexus offers is too good the processor is fast ,the display is jubilant ,the touch screen is good ,feel like the tab dances on your finger instructions ,you will indulge in using the tab ,i just gifted this to my wife ,hope she likes it ,i am basically a doctor and i am exploiting the tab for reading books and surfing videos don't hesitate to buy a masterpiece :)
Product is good, but FLIPKART Service is extremely poor. Nobody communicates with you - the retailer, the courier or flipkart.
It's an excellent product and the overall buying experience was good too. My only regret is that I bought it a little too soon out of impulse. The product was selling cheaper a week after buying (felt cheated) and also, there's been a new google nexus in the market (2013) which looks far far better.
If you are seeking a high performance tablet in a tight budget, then this is the one for you. There are many reviews of the product on various portals and sites. All I can say is that it is a great product and it would have been awesome if it had a Primary high Resolution Camera as well in addition to the secondary front facing camera.
Value for Money. Faster enough to run what ever APP you throw at the processor. Good battery back up. Crystal clear display, sharper than a Super Amoled LED screen. Very good when reading ebooks.
Awesome as everyone must've already said... Gr8 cheap alternative to the Ipad. I had to get a samsung tab targus cover for this...i wished there were custom coversits own covers available for nexus
I bought this after the price drop on flipkart. I needed a e-book reader and was also considering a kindle paperwhite. But the paperwhite does not seem to have good pdf reflow support. The nexus 7 is great for reading pdfs as well as ebooks and am very happy with it.
Awesome tab.......... Using since 1 month..no problem at all... Was delivered in just 2 days.. Updated to latest android 4.4.2. Very nice and simple user interface. Worth more than the price.... Very happy with this product. Just go for it. :-)
Flipkart delivered tablet 2 days befor scheduled date !! Excellent shipping service! Used tablet for 10 days and it satisfied me a lot !! Pros : 1. Awesome touch!! I got the definition for buttery smooth touch !! 2. Super HD display ! 3.Powerful NVIDIA Quadcore processor and no irritating lags! 4. Its Google Nexus 7 so latest Android version easily available and greatest development avail at XDA developers!! 5. Awesome gaming performance !! TEGRA 3 GPU !! 6. It can be connected with external hard drives! I tested with a 2 TB HDD ! 7. Gives a luxurious look! And it has superb built quality! Cons: 1. Has faded colors but can be corrected easily ! 2. Battery backup is sligtly low. Got 7 to 7.30 hrs but it can give its best for upto 9 hrs 3. Screen lifted slightly up . But it is hard to notice so no problem Overall: The best device one can get at this price and it wil make us to be entertained. Best suited for reading books, playing games, surfing, and also for watching HD movies!! For an Android enthusiast ,its considered as a device sent from the God! :-) I think its running at low stock! So, order and grab it!! I suggest you to make the order through online payment, so that you wil get the tablet within a day!!
very nice product..fully satisfied..value for money..what else is needed?hi resolution games like gta sa asphalt 8 nfs mw run lyk butter...go for it :)
It is an awesome product. I must say about the touch, wow! really superb. I have iPad4, Samsung Grand2 and other touch devices but the feel of touch screen is extremely good in Nexus 7. The only bad thing is the sound is not that much louder. But with headphone along MX Player s/w decoder (200%) volume booster, you can enjoy very good music! Battery is adequate for a day usage (movies, games, browsing & mainly all time YouTube). Have got updated to 4.4.2 (OTA) - its a butter smooth experience with KitKat. All together its a good 7" tablet which is fit in budget. Go for it!
Have been using the product from around one and half month. Never seen the product hanging or getting stuck. Display is really wonderful and smooth. No controversy in calling it a gaming beast. Worth or delivers more than the money you spend on it. Best product in this price range. Please note you read the specs completely prior to purchase. And do not regret purchasing a product without rear camera and Sim or 3G support. If you can overcome these difficulties, this is absolutely the product you are looking for As usual Flipkart does deliver before the promised date.
Got mine 32 GB one day in advance to the time promised. Frankly first time tablet user so cant say much about the product... but enjoying.... any tips please share...yes volume is no issue as we can get to change the volume in settings... will write more soon... right now well the exitement exitement.......So far very good and great value for money... especially for games and movies...go for it if you are not looking for calling facility, camera facility to take photos and videos. So much of space literally all games can easily get in. Thanks to all especially flipkart. P S It would be much better if the delivery boy/girl could give a call at least one hour in advance before arriving....otherwise...no issues....Good day...
I researched around one month to buy tablet for Ebook reading and social networking uses,This is one of the Best Tablet in In Indian Market, i order on New year offer, Nexus 7 32 GB, i prefer 32 GB because i have many video tutorial. Flipkart delivery is not good now days. I received the product on 4th Jan,it was told to deliver on 3rd Jan, and i found that product was damage, it was not working, after few hour I order for replacement , they send on committed time, I received the product on 8th Jan, This one was good, and it has become more than 20 days to use , i m very much happy with this product, and also i checked this Serial number on Asus website, i found that product is 100% Genuine, this is my first product which i brought from Flipkart. Reason to buy this product: 1. This is cheapest tablet in Indian Market with Android Kit Kat 4.4 I updated. 2.Touch is superb 3.Battery back is not good after updating kit kat 4.4 , but i manage to disabled few apps and now battery is good, 4. Web surfing more than 10 hours 5. Video playing 8 hours 6. Game 5 hours Overall this product is better than Galaxy. Cons: 3.5 Headphone jack not working i have to hold then it is working , I don't know what to do with jack. I m giving 4 out of 5 because of headphone jack. if flipkart manage to fix this problem that would be great.
Excellent for reading, browsing and games. Good enough for watching movies. Sound quality is mediocre, even with good headphones. PS. If you are tech-savvy, could get USB 3G dongle to work through OTG cable.
1st of all hats off to Flipkart for thier superfast delivery. 5 star for them. Very good product at this price. pros: 1) Good handy Size 2) 7 inch Gorilla glass screen is good for everything(Gaming,Movies, Web Browsing, Office work etc) 3) Excellent processor! No sign of lag even after using 3 heavy apps at a time. 4) Nvidia Tegra! Name says it all. 5) Google product so run latest version of android before any other brand! 6) Very good battery backup. 7) Good Charger as well. Device took less time to get recharged.!! Cons: 1) No 3g sim support. (But i don care as i use my mobiles hotspot for internet, also i don need to recharge internet pack on two different sim cards :P) 2) No Back camera. 3) No USB OTG i guess. (though hvnt tried it yet) 4) No memory card slot.
SALAAM...... Flipkart is giving Excellent Service, I had ordered it on EID-E-MILAD on 14th Jan n get delivery in Just Two Days Amazing Service, NEXUS7 & AMAZER CASE, With Excellent Packing.., and i bought amazer case with tab n i got discount from flipkart Thanx FLIPKART, After Using it for 12 days, i m giving my opinion, NEXUS7 is the Best tab in market, those who r thinking to buy go for it, its a GAMING TAB, and it never LAG or Hang anywhere, i bought NEXUS7 32gb for 10,999, battery life is excellent but it take too much time to fully charged, camera is also very good but u can't open Camera without downloading APP for Camera, it works with WI-FI only if u does'nt have WI-FI u can't use it. NOTE : I had bought a nice Flip case from market n i put the tab in it, n when i start playing game in ma tab its display was blank, it because of MAGNETS in the cover so Avoid using cover which contains MAGNETS in it.

This was my second nexus 7 purchase. Coming from an Apple user - U can't go wrong with this tablet. Be sure to get the free KitKat update and u are done. This is the best tablet money can buy (within the specific budget of 15k) but I would recommend shelling that extra amount to get the Nexus 7 2013 Edition. Either way this tablet provides all the bells and whistles one can expect from a flagship tablet. Amazing value for money.
I had used a friends nexus 7 before I bought this one. Good performance, 32 GB is a lot of memory, I have installed many all FPS games and it works fabulously, the following games run on this without any lag whatsoever. FPS Games: Dead Trigger 1, Dead Trigger 2, NOVA 3, Modern Combat 4, Enemy Strike, SquadStrike, Blood Zombies HD Other Games: Subway Surfer,Temple Run 2, Angry Birds, Angry Birds Star Wars, Real Racing 3, Deer Hunter 2014, Cut the Rope, Candy Crush Saga, Bejwelled Bitz, Badland, Wordament, Dhoom 3 Cons: Once in a while I get ghost in the machine syndrome, its as if someone is touching a particular part of the screen, this will interfere with the unlocking as well as automatically open a particular app, due to the app icon location, turning it on and off and cleaning the screen gets rid of it, and it occurs randomly sometimes once or twice a week, but I can live with that!
This is the best tablet available in the market to day. Don't wait for the 2013 one because the cost will never go down! All heavy graphics games work like a charm on this amazing device... Also there is 32 GB of all the space you will ever need. Cons: 1- Does not play movies in full screen and subtitles. 2-Does not play many formats like avi , flv , mkv etc But friends all the problems can be solved by downloading MX PLAYER from Google Play . Definately a Must Buy Don't think just go ahead. You won't get such heavy discount in future!!
Well done Flipkart for the best service, product and delivery schedule. Google has brought the best combination of hardware and software for their nexus 7. Being a user of Apple products I can certainly tell you that this product give better performance in speed, touch and overall performance. but it lags behind in Retina display and Apple OS only. Certainly the best combination in this price segment. I appreciate M/s WS retailer also for their best pricing, quality product and safe packing. I recommend this tablet to all. The only problem with this product is that they are not providing any head phone, but it works with all 3.5 mm jack head phones.
i ordered this tab on 24 jan14 on 5pm with one day delievery guarantee and just got it the next day in the morning at 10am,just when i was leaving for college.it was very nicely wrapped and covered.I just loved it at the first sight.It came with android version 4.2.1 but i got the update 4.3 very quickly.I must say this is a very impressive one.This is the lowest price any google product will go. Just buy it,dont go for samsung tabs at all they are pathetic and run on older android version ics(4.0) this tab is also in the list of getting the update 4.4(kitkat) So i would recommend this tab to everyone who have to buy a tab under 15grand
The best Tablet even if u compare with the best class tablet...in the market of any brand.. A quality product at so less price, buy it blindly if u want a handy pc with all the great experience you want to play with it.
Dont think anything...just buy it. Very nice product and great performance in all heavy apps. Delivery is also in very nice packing and mainly originality is inevitable here.
I don't necessarily write a review but this was inevitable. At 10800, this is a steal. 3G is no downside if you have another android phone where you can give it connectivity through hotspot. I mean, you can't anyways use your sim to call in th 3g model so no point putting in 10000 bucks extra. You can install texitng apps and shift your whattsapp on this. And, it is damn fast. for a user using sony xperia, which has a quite good screen quality, this is better. and games are really fast. Butter smooth. Go for it before flipkart runs out of stock. Anf flipkart: 10/10 for you. the delivery time and packing. great !!!!
i tried to contact through email to provide it at my residence in UP City, everytime the replied in a single fashion persons working at helpdesk are like computer having no brain i am ready to pay in advance
I bought this tab after lot of research at 10999 from flipkart Since there are lot of them available in the market. As usual the delivery was within 2 days. My purpose was for pure gaming so i would say the gaming experience is too good.
for this price it is totally worth it. Flipkart delivered it in couple of days. Now buying a otg cable so as to connect my dongle.
Nice Tab with amazing fearures. a must buy tab in such an affordable price. Flipkar service is recommendable.
Its really good. It contains almost all features at less price. Performance is good. Only drawback I can see is It doesn't contain any slot for SIM
This is a awesome product meets all my expectations and worth the price completely. The delivery by flipkart was on time with good packaging.
Truly an amazing experience! Flipkart delivered the product withing 3 days! I will be grateful, as i couldn't contain my excitement! Amazing display.. the sound quality is beyond good.. GREAT for reading books, playing games, browsing.. The camera quality is good as compared to other 1.2mp cams..I would recommend this tab to everyone.. Especially at just 11k, its worth waaaaaayy more then that
Really nice product from Flipkart, the trusted brand for electronics. Got faster delivery. Got upgraded to Kitkat version
Note: My rating is for the product only, not for Flipkart! I bought this product in Oct 2013, when it was listed for 12,999, with a 5% discount on Citibank Credit card. So I bought this for 12,349/- But very soon, within a week Flipkart reduced the price to 11,999/- with further 10% discount for Standard Chartered cards, making the effective price 10,799/-! So within a week I lost 2,200!! Is not this some kind of a joke? Is not this cheating by Flipkart? Thankfully, its an awesome tablet from Google. Look no further, if you're in the market to buy a tablet. The 2012 model is very much cost effective (particularly the 32 GB version, without SIM card). I doubt if Flipkart folks will even publish this review!
Its an awesome tablet I got a good deal we're in I good a 10% cash back by Hdfc credit card. In all I gt an awesome 32gb nexus 2012 fr 10k that's a steal. Regarding tablet it HV a gr8 resolution, speed is good, all games run fine, The only drawback I suppose is speaker which isn't loud enough. In all it WS a gr8 experience.
It is a wonderful product to use.Touch is butter smooth. As of now i don't find any lag during operations of different applications. Battery backup is Ok type.Screen resolution is good.Overall it is a good product to have. Flipkart is also good in delivering as always and the price they offered was really commendable
Bought it from flipkart , got it within 2 days Excellent packaging and mindblowing service from flipkart Talking about the tablet It's blazing fast and has got the latest updates you cant get anywhere except under nexus devices. Excellent Product Good work Google and Asus.
The product is nice and working in good condition and on top of that the service quality of flipkart is very nice. I got the order 1 day before the actual day of delivery...
Pros: - NVIDIA Tegra 3 T30L CPU frequency: 1.2 GHz (up to 1.3 GHz in single-core mode) GPU frequency: 416 MHz RAM: 32-bit single-channel 667 MHz DDR3-1333 (5.34 GB/sec)[26] - Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9 - RAM: 1 GB Cons: - No SD Card support, this means that when you reset the device the entire data is lost unless you back it up. - 7 inches display with 1280 x 800 pixels i.e, only 216 ppi - No primary camera The price will just mask the cons. You can blindly go for this. But if you are still conscious about the performance and afford to spend a few more rupees the latest is the best bet at 20K :P
Compact and Good Graphics Processing Capabilities. Decent Battery Life. I gifted this tab to mom for social networking and usual browsing purposes this Christmas. I personally use an iPad Retina and iPhone 5S. (Apple Fan) ? Soon I realised that this Nexus 7 32GB WIFI is no slouch either. I could play a 2.1GB NFS MOST WANTED and Casual Temple Run OZ (at highest video quality settings) back to back for more than an hour and still have 85% battery left. (Tip for beginners: Game always with lesser brightness and clearing RAM) Almost All Apps/Games on PlayStore run without any lag on this device running Kitkat 4.4.2 and Nova Launcher Enabled to give it more of a Nexus 5 full screen look ? Nexus 7 2013 is a good option too. But if u wanna gift someone any gadget, this should be your 1st option. Super Cheap yet Powerful.
Does exactly what it states to do.... Am happy with the product and the way it works. A file manager application would have been useful.
Good Product in good price. : - Good quality - Affordable price - : - Battery life is very low especially when you watch videos.
I bought this tab mainly to read e-books. However I was surprised to know that almost every graphically-heavy game works on it. FIFA 14, Real racing 3, GT Racing 2 and the likes. Also it was instantly updated to Kitkat on connecting to wifi. The quality of the tab is excellent and feels nice to hold. The speakers are surprisingly good. Rs. 9900 for the 32 GB version (I bought it during an offer)... I think it was a steal. Satisfied with the tablet and the service from Flipkart.
Excellent tab for this price range Got the Latest update 4.4 Awesome display screen A great value for money Extraordinary service from flipkart.....
I spend most of my time with this :) for me it is better than S4 too.. yay I watch movies , play games , HD games , hear songs , study books , do a lot of video chat on skype.. I installed whatsapp and viber too :D GOOGLE NEXUS 7 (2012) rox A great value for money [ one of the best android tab ]
OVER ALL A GOOD TAB...It would have been good if one a rear camera available... delivery time was quick..3days ahead..
Just Awesome.. No problems.. everything seems so perfect(except one thing).. You will not be disappointed(price to value ratio). At this price range (below 10k), there is no better option than this. I found that left bottom corner heats up a bit. About 35 degrees C, after googling most people say that this is normal
This tablet is real value for money, because although it is located in the middle of the price range of the available tablets, it looks and performs close to the high end tablets. Made by Asus with Google's Android Jelly Bean 4.2, it auto-upgraded to version 4.3 a couple of days after purchase. The Nexus fits the hand well, is not heavy, and the display is bright. It is fast enough for most functions. I have downloaded quite a few apps, but Google Play does not yet offer music in India. However, I managed to copy music from my Windows PC, ignoring the error messages that come up.
Nexus 2012 has all the features of a good tablet except that it is missing 3G. when it comes to 7 inches tablet, using it as a phone and also as a tablet will be cumbersome. instead of investing nearing 20k for a 3G tablet, it is better to have this nexus along with an another android phone in the range of around 9k. I have a samsung SDUOS and easily using wifi hotspot on that phone, i can use this tablet anywhere. For recieving calls we use samsung SDUOS and for tablet applications we have nexus. We are also using this as a external monitor for our DSLR using helicon remote and DSLR dashboard. for these applications no other tablet supports so well as nexus. as usual flipkart services were awesome as we got this delivered in just one day. Awesome Product.
i bought this tablet 3 days ago from flipkart....as always extraordinary service from flipkart....now about the tablet.... 1. its a nexus. 2. latest update to android kitkat 4.4 3. 32gb internal 4. really cheap guys dont wait....just buy it if u want the best tablet experience!!!
I will have to agree that if you are looking around for a budget tablet with best specs, the Nexus 7 is a sure shot winner out of the lot. Its touch is far far better than those within this price range available in the market. If you know how to root it (easy guides and tutorials available online) then there's no looking back! The only negative I would say is the no-back camera, but I guess I can live with it coz the others with one are either with useless camera's or too expensive/delicate to hand it to my 4 year old son for whom it is meant to be a birthday gift!
HAI my name is sajin and i purchase a google nexus 32 gb from flipkart the usage of this device is great because iam using apple now when i used this device i like it very much because its speed and smooth touch and whole i like it very well thanks google
The tab from google is really good.there is no lagging.A real value for money.Enjoy the experience.Only one diffculty is need to root when connect USB by Total Commander APP.
Excellent Buy. As good as it gets. Had bought it as anew year gift for my daughters. Delivered instantly. has already got updated to android 4.4.2. Fast and furious sums up the description. Of course 2012 version but with specs and price a dream buy.
I started off browsing Flipkart to buy a decent tablet around 7k for my little one, when I stumbled upon an eye-popping offer on Flipkart- Nexus 7 32gb at 12 thousands! I wasted no time in ordering for the same and here I am, pleased as ever. Having bought this tab is the wisest thing I've done, i mean, Google products require no intro, do they? Most definitely the best tab around and at 12k, not only is it a steal, it is more than worth its salt! Go for it, before the offer runs out!
I bought this tab 1 month back. I must tell that, I am in love with this tab. But the tab does not come with a screen protector and earphones. Except for this there are no other complaints.
I ordered the product on 30th Dec 2013 and it was delivered to me on 3rd of Jan 2014 i.e with in 5 days. After receiving the tablet i have installed a number of application which can be run. Till now i have no problem with these applications and games. Battery life is also good. Overall a good tablet within this price tag.
This tab from google and asus has created a benchmark for other tabs. Awesome processor, perfect for true multitaskung and gaming, no lags, perfect response. Pros Amazing processor Enough ram Good touch response Good storage (32gb) low price Cons No camera (but thats not what tabs are for) Low sunlight legibility Speaker volume slightly on lower side All in all the pros far outweigh the cons and such brilliant tab for Rs11,000 minus cashback, i am happy. :-D
It is really very good.... I am not a tech savy... I actually bought it to my parents they found it very good and easy to use.
Great product, prompt delivery. The Asus Nexus 7 is a beautiful device that provides the very best in touchscreen capabilities.
I Loved it. Really awesome tab.. I ever had.. Cool one.. Huh! Nice Features and many more.. But it sucks my 3G internet more. When i go to play store and browser . my internet charges more... Wow.. But Stunning graphics.. And really nice for . Gaming.. But it was nice if it was support flash 11.1 .. To play games in fb . But all over the tab. Is realy nice one and awesome.. I had. Thx to flipkart that delivered to me in 2days.
I was used to lags in my NXG tablet earlier, but N7 is amazing. Now I realized the importance of 'brand'. Absolute wonder is what I can rate it as. I immediately got an update of v4.4.2 which is not found in other brands. I am only finding the charging point a bit tight to plug into the tablet, rest no complaints at all. Clarity is stunning!! Thanks FK for delivery within 1 day as promised!
I got a nexus 7.It was great but then its screen started to lag so i filed for a replacement. I got it in three days. but i realised that i didn't take a backup of the old one.I called them in less than an hour of the delivery. The delivery man said its not possible for him to return and then i called flipkart services. the recording said"your call will be recorded to better our services'' when the line was transferred to a person she said its not possable and that i wasent the first one to call with the problem many people had called saying this.Even during delivery the if i call the service they just place the order no. on the webpage and tell me its status, something i know. so my question is Why do they even have a "flipkart service" if the do not do us any service I give 8/10 to ASUS and google. Its stupid things like this that took the publics trust from ebay. i am giving it one star as i can't give zero.
Very high performance, zero lags with surfing and Gaming. Butter smooth touch, Awesome display. Battery life is amazing. 2nd day of purchase i used it for 12 hours on wifi and Gaming. Asus and Google had Just made a wonderful product. Thanks to flipkart
I bought this Tab for Rs.10,999 . Flipkart delivered it in 2 days. Only one thing I can say about Google Nexus 7 is that its value for money. Best Tab at this price.
I was looking for a basic media consumption device with casual gaming. My needs being reading a few books, watching movies on the go, and perhaps a little bit of casual gaming. A tablet can only be a media consumption device, a sort of companion to your phone. And this tab does the job excellently. The screen is good enough (its not 1080p like the 2013 model, but the experience of watching movies as well as reading books is very good owing to its 217ppi count.), the processor is decent to run almost all the games available on the play store and its the right size too. For anyone who wants to use their tablet as not more than that i mentioned above, this is a steal. CON: The battery life seems quite low to me, but that could improve once it runs a few cycles of charges. Apart from this, there is no problem at all. As usual, flipkart was exceptional with its service, delivering the product to me one day earlier.
the price at which flip kart delivers is great in all aspect. the tablet is better both touch response and display quality. i can say it is above average tablet, but the price in which flipkart is delivering makes it better.
I bought this awesome tablet few weeks back.I found that its a great tablet after IPad. Really value for money. Pros: Value for money Great performance No lagging Great gaming experience.World's first Quad Core Tablet Easy to use. Awesome Google card and Google Now Display is simple awesome. NFC Support WIFI Direct Cons: Only front facing camera. No 3G Single speaker. Sound is not strong. If you use good headphone then I will be ok. 3.5mm Headphone jack at bottom of the tablet. !!!! This fault has been rectified in Nexus 2nd gen For hardcore gamer 1GB ram not sufficient.Go for Nexus 2nd gen.
Nexus 7 (2012) is the worst purchase I regret my desion. I used 2 of the device and both of them stopped working after 20,40 days repectively.At first when my device broke flipkart was kind enough to replace mine but now as i used it for more than 40 days no replacement now. My actual condition of my tablet is that it was working fine till it worked and then it would not turn on at all. Both had the same issue. Without even rooting my device it got BRICKED. when I contacted ASUS coustomer support the just replied in a single line saying "take your model to the nearest service center". My nearest service center is 1500km away from where I live in. Worst support from ASUS. But a good service from flipkart though to replce my !st defective peice. Please avoid this NEXUS 7 and go with APPLE if you can stretch your budget, the main reason for recommending apple products is you get coustomer service which you might have never experienced in India, if your device stops working you can get a brand new replacement for the entire 1st year of purchace from APPLE( PERSONAL EXPERIENCE).
There is some technical flaw in the product , I am not sure how it could be ignored it takes a lot of time to charge up again if it's battery is fully discharged , I would like to return the product for a replacement or a repair , whichever is possible
If you're looking for a tab without the calling feature, this is the best. You can do your own comparisons but can assure you the quality of the product is excellent. It beats over priced Samsung and others any day. Bought this product at 11,999/- and very satisfied after using it for over a month now. Also Flipkart did a good job with the delivery.
What is the use of such a "STAND ALONE" device that have NO mode of "OFFLINE DATA TRANSFER". DO I have to DOWNLOAD a MOVIE every time I wanna see it ??? And wht if my net connection goes slow for a few days? HOW would I TRANSFER PHOTOS FROM my CAMERA ??? I would have surely bought it if it had Card AND USB access! Dear @Google, are u listening? Apart from this apparent crack, excellent device all together.
I purchased Google Nexus 7 1 month back. It was neatly packaged when got delivered to me. This is a great product which came to me. If you are not looking for back camera this is a cool product. You can tether your phone if you want to access internet.
Buying this tablet I feel I have started loving it. The speed is zippy, display wonderful and this tablet is good to read e-Books too. I would recommend anyone impressed with iPAD to once give Google Nexus 7 a try, I am sure it would prove itself.
The tablet is a steal for this price but there are some issues that people have to be mindful of. First and foremost, you become a tester of google's latest releases since auto system update cannot be turned off. The recent 4.3 and 4.4 updates have caused quite some havoc wrt battery life. It takes quite some analysis and effort to sort these out. The next major issue is that the display calibration is out right pathetic. The colors and gamma are wayy off and have to be manually calibrated. But that requires rooting and not sure how many people are comfortable with doing that like me. Some popular communication apps like wechat/whatsapp outright crash on kitkat and of course getting them to work on a tablet takes some manual effort involving talkplus etc. If you are willing to put up with all this, go ahead and buy it. This is definitely not a tablet for our mom/dad :)
What more can you ask for 11k ? Flipkart gave it on cheapest price. Everything works fine on this tablet; processing, display, features apps, UI etc etc. MUST Buy!
Go for it guys. I bought 32gb google nexus 7 during new year offer. With 10% extra offer for my hdfc card. Very smooth and total steal for 10000rps. Though battery back up is no so gud. Rest all feature is awesome.
I was looking for a 7 inch tablet for long time.I pads are unreasonably costly and Indian Brands lacks proper quality.This was perfect for me. It should be perfect for you too if you want a tablet capable of handling most new games and apps
I bought this product a few weeks ago and am finding it to be an amazing product really. the Google team has put together a really good piece of tech-gadget in the market. Pros: -> The NVIDIA Tegra Processor is amazing and very efficient. -> The tab's 32GB internal memory is a real bonus. ->The display and user-friendly features also make this a really good piece. ->The RAM is also quite supportive. Cons: ->No rear camera. ->No sim/3g support only Wi-Fi
Hi, i purchased this product on 2 January and today it automatically got switched off and is not starting/charging. will return it :(
Pros: Handy, value for money, google brand name. Cons:Internet only accesible through wi-fi, no rear camera
Excellent Service including return service by Flipkart and team. There was an issue with the product and filpkart replaced promptly today i.e., within 48 hours of my return/replacement request. Nexus 7 (2012) is good tab and exploring the options. Hope would be a good companion for my day to day activities.
Best tablet one can get without burning holes in the pocket. It is full with features and working is very smooth. One does not expect anything less from Google.
I received this product on 28th Dec 2013. The flipkart service is awesome but the product quality and performance is so bad. I am facing lot problem with this product mainly charging, display blinking and heating problem. So please new buyer do not choose this product.Its waste of money as well as time. Subbu.
the product is very good in all its functionalities. however a rear camera could have been included as well. i had bought this a s a gift for my parents and didnt really check for a rear camera as a rear camera, i think is generally bundled even with cheap phones. that was a disappointment though my mistake in not checking out the features. the first thing that my dad asked after opening and switching on the product was "does it have a camera" !
My friend bought the 8Gb version a year back for 13k, this is a deal at 12k. Couldn't find a good cover for a decent price though. ebay has a good deal on screen protectors for this device. Upgraded to 4.4.2 in two steps, first to 4.3 and then 4.4.2. Two heavy downloads of about 190mb each.
Fast and speedy tablet. The only concern is battery drain which with normal usage last about 8 hours on full charge.
Good tab at reasonable price. but only concern has been the battery backup. Please suggest me is their any way to replace the battery of it. any concerned vendor......
Amazing tab....a must have for all techies....delivered in a 6days...thts the bad part thts all...rest all was just fine...thnk u flipkart fr the reasonable price
This is really a very good tab. Only issue is, bit of heating on continuous usage for more than half-an-hour. I am not giving five stars for this reason. But, performance wise, its great.
I have used and handled a number of tablets in last couple of years. I can say for sure that Google Nexus is the best of the lot. It is compact with a very good build quality and just perfect features and hardware internals. It is the only tablet with hardly much bloatware hence it works more efficiently and also effectively helps save power guzzling unlike most loaded tablets in the marketplace. Very happy with the price too. Display is excellent and gorilla glass makes a real diff.
Again I will start with Flipkart delivery system. One word "Amazing". My order was delivered just above 24 hrs. I was really amazed by the system and would like Flipkart to keep it up. On the product... As the title says, its from Google and it has to be cheap. It was a steal for me and I picked it up the moment I noticed the price drop. The tablet does not have the quality of Apple but does justice to the price it available for. I use the device only for Games and find it many times stall when playing resource hunger apps or games. Overall, happy with the device though I would have been a happier with an extra GB of RAM (2012 model has 1GB). And being Google, I'm guaranteed to get quick updates and dont have to wait for the ASUS to send out customized updates.
Every penny spent is worth and best value for money...but it is not about money only. I always had apprehension for Android & in fact this my first own product. And first experience is just extraordinary. Flipcart is in all my purchased till date is standout !!! Just wonderful !!!
It was a timely delivery, received on 31 Dec 13, a perfect time to start with this new tab. No defects and a nice packing. Product is as you know it from the reviews. It is good for the price offered. And i was lucky that 1000 was increased after my order was delivered.
The technical specs are available all over the internet for you to see. However, the ethnic value is what that makes this this product worth every paise. It feels good, has no-nonsense design and has everything you need to do what ever it is that you need it to do. A perfection. A beauty. A Beast.
Its been the best buy for me...no issues with the hardware and smooth touch .excellent graphics and a on time perfect delivery from flipcart ...only con is that a good case for it very hard to find
I got my google nexus 7 2012 on 31 jan 2013. This one has got issue with colors. The screen colors look faded, washed out, with little saturation. My intex aqua i5 looks great in comparison. And the headphone also has problems. Nexus 7 is not shipped with headphones,so I had to use my intex headphones. Whether its a compatibility issue or manufacturing problem I am not sure, because sound over headphone is simply pathetic. I was watching a video over my intex aqua i5, with headphone on , the sound was fantastic.The same video on nexus 7 with the same headphone had very poor sound quality. Touch is amazing. Battery lasts for only 4.5 to 5 hour of heavy use. while playing games it lags a little after a while. I had high expectations. Did not meet to expectations. I don't know now whom to complain to. Safdar
100 out of 100 for google nexus just go and get it only from flipcart, i received in just 2 days and working well. will suggest you to go for wifi model
Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet is a nice tablet in the world of tables... Gaming and video calling experience is amazing... Internet browsing is also very good... The most important thing is the android version updating facility...now I am using android version 4.4.2 kitkat... It's superb....
Amazing tablet. Must buy. If you are worried about the performance of this tablet citing its cost , let me tell you that I have been playing some of the biggest and heaviest android games available on market (Asphalt 8 , GT 2 , Fifa 14) on this tablet smoothly . Not even once has this tab crashed. Build quality : good. Screen: the best I have seen for a budget like this. The front camera is decent enough for video calls (via net , there's no sim card slot here). Cons: no back camera (this hasn't bothered me a bit because the back camera on your tablet shouldnt be one of your priorities while you purchase one) its a GOOD PURCHASE , one which you wont regret. Thanks.
Considering its price,it is one of the best tablet you can get now.But there is one draw back for the nexus 7 tablet probably most of us have encountered. The battery wont get chargered some times and the tab remains dead.There is an easy solution for this probably most of you people know and when it gets started its one hell of a beast. And one advise from me is not to go for android 4.4.2 update as it has a lot of bugs as of now for the nexus series.Most impt problem is the battery backup. So keep 4.3 as of now and go for the 4.4.2 update once the fixes are there.
Perfect Tablet for Gaming and looking forward to buy 2013 Model. I wish if it has calling option as well, then it could have captured Indian Market more than Samsung Tablets.
Waited a lot to get this product at cheaper price.. And it was really a worth the wait for this kind of classy product at the cost of 11k.. Although the 2013 version feels better in specs. but right now its too pricey compared to the 2012 version, Flipkart 1 day delivery is also awesome.
Just upgraded the OS the Android Kitkat 4.4.2. Read some of the adverse effects of this upgrade on the net - such as poor wi-fi signal, poor battery life. However, I didn't find any of those problems with my tablet after the upgrade. The UI is smooth and has no lag at all. The app drawer opens up even faster than before. The speaker sound is quite loud. The HD playback has no complaints at all! Overall - feel free and safe to upgrade to Android Kitkat v4.4.2.
Price , features and look is good. My kid is enjoying his new tab.Pretty fast and easy to configure.Delivered in good packing and fast delivery by flipkart.
This product justifies the term 'true value for money', especially at Flipkart price. 32GB @11k is just a steal. First thing anyone would notice about the tab is its fantastic build quality. It feels great to hold the tab in hand and the grip is amazing. Not even once I felt that it would slip from my hand. Upgradation to Kit Kat version is icing on the cake. Have been using the product for about a week now and so far havent experienced any sort of lag. Display is treat for eyes and it comes with decent battery back up. Note that this tab doesnt come with rear camera, it features only front cam. But, it wasnt a deal breaker for me. At the end of day its a fantastic buy which provides a premium feel, pure android at an irrestible price.
AM interested in buying this device. Does this device support 3G using a sim card? I need both wifi and 3G cellular compatibility.
it was really nice to get this nexus 7 2012 edition at such price which i consider value for money with fastest delivered to me.
Excellent product for the price - Did not find any product with this kind of finish and specs at this price range
This is an excellent tablet and meets all the requirements for me except for one...it does not have a Primary Camera. You would expect that in any devise of this segment and hence I didn't check the specifications minutely. Very disappointing but can't do much now. Otherwise excellent product for this price and excellent services by the seller (WS Retail) and FlipKart.
Display blinking/ flickering on lower brightness, returned for the second time lets see what happens for the third device. Just for the record for reference, (as have sen in th post yaar ruk jata to acha hota :P) listed price here on FlipKart dated 30-Dec-2013 is [Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet 32gb - 10,999 INR]. with 10% discount on HDFC credit or debit card that comes around 10,000. not a bad deal at all . bought on this deal only there was no idea in my mind to go for any new tablet as earlier was having nextbook 1ghz tablet with ICS 4.0. Yeah so experience with flipkart was not that delighting, on website i found 10 percent discount on both nexus 7 (2012) 16 gb and 32 gb models called 4 times to flipkart officials and surprising thing is twice they said "sir this discount is available for 16 gb model also with listed price 8999" [[Google Nexus 7 2012 Tablet 16gb - 8,999 INR]. and twice they denied.this was really confusing and ambiguous situation i ended up with 32 gb model as wanted to get that 10 percent discount at any cost. but FK you really need some trained staff with sound knowledge of products here on this site and available offers. This is my second purchase with flipkart and no bad experience so far with delivery and quality of product. Price offered is incomparable. hope you grow this way only FK respect! Got defective product first time now waiting for replacement ! screen flickers randomly after some R&D got to know this is due to improper installation of battery cant fix this my self as that will void warranty. Havnt got product yet will edit my review but as obvious great product from google and theres nothing new to expect.. too much excited for this nexus's nexus ;).
I bought this tablet few days ago. Overall experience is good except battery backup.. I have mentioned some pros and cons: pros: 1) Great display quality 2)Supports majority of games without lags 3)Smooth transitions 4)Descent build quality cons: 1)Avg battery backup: If you are into continuous gaming like subway surf,temple run battery will get empty within 5 hours.. If you are into browsing then battery standby will be around 6 hours. 2)No ear phones in the box. Apart from battery life everything is great about this tablet..If you are not an extreme hardcore game lover then this is the the best buy...Even extreme game lover could buy this tab but battery is the small issue..Think and decide yourself
I never expected such a brilliant experience from a device of this price range.. Google's OS and its stringent spec pricing selection are the only keys for the success of this product.
Kindly let me know does it supports 3g data card and whats app?............. n if yes then which data card it wil support..
I got the 32 GB model as this does not support additional storage by means of a MicroSD card. There are enough reviews here that list all the benefits of this device, so I am not going to repeat them here. For this price, this is the best tablet you can find, and you will not regret the purchase one bit. Just remember that this one does not come with a rear camera, and battery life is not the best (not bad either). But then again, look at the price, and do not hesitate.
The best bang for your buck... Brilliant product from ASUS and Google..
Flipkart service is very good, comes to tab fantastic look , with in a minute I got 4.3 update and again 4.4.2 kitkat, performance is very good, Best tab at this price, 32gb is perfect choice for gamers as it doesn't contain memory slot also.. value for money is very small word for this tab
Bought this just as the newer 2013 Nexus 7 was launched at a heavily discounted price of Rs.11,999. Just as I received it, the priced dropped further...but still a great buy. The Nexus is sleek, light and much faster than I anticipated. The screen was a revelation, viewing angles are better than the ipad mini. Texts and colours are sharp and bright. Setting up the system was a piece of cake and took not more than 20 mins and it was good to go! The software was upgraded two days later with the newer version! The build quality is good in that there are no dust collecting gaps etc. The lack of any physical home button is a bit annoying but guess one would get used to the touch soft keys eventually. Only gripe from flipkart is that the head phones are not a part of the buy and you have to buy a screen protector separately as well which would probably be thrown in if I was to buy them from a brick and mortar shop.
The price and specs are really awesome with google live updates is really uncomparable to other brands.. so this tablet is the best for me................................
Amazing product at the price range. It is noway inferior to any samsung tab within 20k. I purchased 32GB edition as there is no option to expand memory.
Already had one, this was my second purchase, you can never go wrong with Nexus. Flipkart delivered the product in good pack, and timely.
One of the best product that I got from flipkart. I have an ipad and in comparison and for the money that I paid , it's really worth . The screen resolution is great and works smoothly when connected to wifi. The only problem is when you double tap it , it's gets struck and has to be shutdown and restarted.
Google Nexus 7 (32 GB) is really an awesome tab, I did lot of comparison before going for it and I finally decided to go for this one and I am happy about my decision. I would recommend this Tab, an fabulous product for this price. Thanks for flipkart for its fast delivery !!!! Regards, Kiran Kumar
nexus 7 2012 is a steal for the price and I got a 32gb one......even better.......the specs are very good and it runs very fast with heavy apps too.......Fantastic.....
Thanks to Google & Flipkart for providing this Awesome Tab at this price . Quality at its best . Real Enjoyment for Android lovers
A nice piece of hardware . This is by far a good tab for 11k [GOSF sale] from flipkart. The tab was uploaded to 4.4.2 Kitkat within 1hour of start up. Quite impressed with the flikart delivery and the price during GOSF sale.
Great job Google. Brilliant device, amazing display. Absolutely love it!!!! I cannot find anything that I did not like. Google ROCKZZZZ
A good product from google. Just love the speed and the screen resolution. Its Compatible and weightless and a real companion for travel even when they dont support 3G.
This tab is worth the money and being a google product, the android versions are updated early. Storage is reduced to close to 26gb due to many reasons and ram usage never crosses 650mb. Overall, runs very fast and smoothly. Already updated to android 4.4.2. No primary cam. Secondary cam runs decently. Skype calls running fine.
The Nexus 7, as is well-known, is a versatile tablet, and esp. at the price at which Flipkart is selling it. my device though had the infamous screen-flicker issue, which could be irksome for those who use their tabs to read at night under low brightness settings on the tab. anyway, got it replaced soon after realised the issue. the customer-service and follow-up was a breeze! got it replaced in no time! however, the 2nd tab too had the same issue, and i requested for another replacement, but Flipkart expressed its inability to do so (took their time to thoroughly enquire about this first, though), and offered me the full refund for the tab as well as the extended warrant-kit that i had purchased. got the refund in a few days, and it was a totally hassle-free experience of mine, with Flipkart's stellar service to back it up! even though the tabs had issue, this was my best experience so far in e-shopping and allied service! other portals should definitely take a cue from Flipkart and follow suite! kudos!
Great tablet for casual internet browsing and media usage. Slightly irritated by the fact that the bluetooth connection to the speakers sttuters when I try to Multi task. Being the first to get android updates often means we have to wait for the Applications to upgrade. Have had few apps refuse to work on a higher android version
I've been using this product for past 2-3 months. Kudos to flipkart for delivering the product perfectly packed within the promised time. This is an excellent product from Asus/Google in this price range. They have offered high end technology in such feasible price. Unboubtedly, no tab in this price range can match the performance of N7. Kindle fire has its limitations related to amazon modified android. ASUS fonepad is a competitor but my friends using fonepad had faced some complaints so I din't go for it. Pros: Its a GOOGLE product. First to get any android update(but Google din't exactly keep up to their promise. Nexus users had a 3-4 week delay in getting the Kitkat update). Excellent performance(The processor is too good and overcomes the "just 1gb ram so it will hang" misconception people have) Plays 720p videos, streams Youtube HD seamlessly. Decent audio. Storage extension possible to even TBs if u but an OTG cable which costs less than 200rs. Can play almost all the games which are available in market now. If you are ready to ROOT the device, then the functionality is way more. I use whatsapp, youtube, proxydroid and almost all the apps that are blocked by my college proxy. Cons: Just decent battery life(don't even think about comparing with iPads, but good enough for a tablet of this performance in this price range). 16GB version slows down by the time you install all the apps and fill your storage, Go for 32GB if possible. I own a 32GB version. No FULL HD support. No 1080p videos wont play properly. In case of non 3g versions no GPRS/3G means no internet unless you have a wifi. Hence useless for browsing and navigation while you are travelling. But all the cons are not exactly cons but are limitations of the product that you know beforehand, so basically I will have to say I din't find anything bad about the tab till now. So im left with no choice but to give it a 5/5.
got this during GOSF offers for 10,999/- ...!! i was stalking this tablet for about two months and finally wen the price dropped to this low, i ordered it rite away..!! no tablet better than this in this price range ...!! even till 18-19K...!! No lag , ultimate display , nice battery life ...!! Good for gaming and watch movies ...!! Overall best in the category of tablets ...!!
I am surprised by the quality of the product and that it never hangs...! This is a tablet I bought after a lot of thought and research (also done in flipkart). I find it extremely convenient to manage all my mails and youtube videos online, using the tab. Google's Nexus receives all updates almost instantaneously and this is ever so true, as I got my Android version 4.12 recently updated to 4.4 This is also a practical equipment, since it allows for longer playback time, thanks to the software upgrade. Must consider buying it.. If you had bought it in the recently concluded GOSF it was available at an awesome price too. Would recommend this to all buyers who are considering a budget priced hi-quality, top of the spec product.
This is by far the best value for money tablet available in the Indian market on date. Pricing is very good on this site compared to competing portals and delivery was speedy as usual. Plus points 1) Immediately updated to latest Kitkat version 2) Display is very sharp and Corning Glass is relatively smudge free. 3) Very light weight and good texture on the back Negatives 1) Lack of rear camera irks when using augmented reality apps and their ilk 2) Choice of covers available for this tablet are very limited here.
Flip kart offered the same tab 32GB/3G for 15K in Diwali sale, the so called biggest online sale that there was in India, bull ! As soon as Diwali was over FlipKart immediately brought the product price down by, wait for it ... 3 K !!! The same thing is available now for 12 K ! Why would you do this to me FlipKart ? Why would you call something the biggest online sale and then sell the same product cheaper as sooon as the sale time is over !!! Plus the product you delivered to me the first time was faulty, it had to be replaced ! And as you can see from other reviews I am not the only one who got the rejected products in the name of Diwali sale. My guess is these guys are most likely fixing the faulty products and selling it for cheaper price, FlipKart atleast have the balls to say this product is refurbished !!! AVOIDDDD
Cool Tablet.... Gaming effect is very good. Little bit heat when play games. but it's ok it happen with almost tablet & mobile. Really worth of investment in Nexus. I am buy in GOSF so my purchase cost is Rs. 10999/- i am so happy........
This is a tablet that's well worth every penny paid for it. It doesn't disappoint one bit, and excels in delivering what the specifications and description promise. I received it in a day's time and the delivery was made within the time promised. I'm yet to hear of reviewers complaining of Flipkart's delivery service, so whoever is in-charge of logistics is doing a bang-up job. As for the tablet, I'm sure the positives other reviewers listed are quite true and accurate. So, I'll just mention the good things I found pleasing with the Nexus 7. Firstly, the device fits snugly into ones hand and does not threaten a fall. The design is spot-on and is made to please. The product arrived with JellyBean version 4.2.1. As soon as the initial registration process was through, it prompted an update to JellyBean 4.3. Soon after I landed with the updated version, the next prompt (to my surprise) came up. The tablet now runs 4.4.2 (KitKat). The response is very smooth, does not lag and with intermittent use, ran for 2 days and 16 hours before the battery-low warning showed at 14%. Now, for the negatives: The tablet does not have a rear-camera. Unlike the 2013 version, this one feels incomplete without the rear camera. I honestly don't use the camera much, but it'd have been a terrific product had it had one. The screen size could've been a tad bit bigger and would make viewing movies/video clips a lot more fun on a larger screen. The stock apps that come bundled could do with a face lift. It's true that we can download them off the Android market, but adding the right set of apps along would've made the experience a lot sweeter. Now, these are my personal opinions and are the things I'd have considered if I was in charge of designing the product. For the price it retails at, it's a great deal and a fun gadget to own!
I would definitely not say this is the best tablet out there. But, given the price bracket in which it falls, it certainly is a great buy. Bought this for my dad who had no experience of using touch interface and he is having a great time on it. Kudos to Google
I comepared with all contempory devices find out best to buy ..100% Value for money..Amazing device superb performance.. Best feature :Display and 100% Androide Device its automaticaly upgrade to 4.4.2 kitket .. you can also try kindle Fire HDX but its not 100% androide ..
I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was Superb, i got the tab within 2 days. i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The Battery usage more than 6hrs very good. The Screen & graphics are very good (HD, I love them). This is the gaming tablet. Excellent Tab
Overall its a very nice product,it feels nice to use it. Battery is fantastic, Sound is great. But i really miss the rear camera and feel helpless because it has only wifi, i could have waited a little more and rather bought the new Nexus Tablet by Google. But its nice, it does its job really well of keeping me entertained.
Nexus 7 by Google is truly value for money. Slight heating issue and a below average camera but all the games run so nicely. As the product is by Google, Android updates are applied first.
My experience with the Nexus 7 was too good. I got it at the reduced price probably because the 2nd Generation Nexus 7 was about to be launched, but honestly love the device and the performance I get. Feels really good in the hand and no lag while using it. Only reason it lost the last star was cause the Kit Kat upgrade wasn't on par with the one bundled in Nexus 5. Els all in all a great device.
Researched a lot and got two of them (One for a nephew). It's really fast and smooth. Delivers what all the specifications tell you. Including NFC - tested it and it's fun. No starting problems like the ones specified. Other than the following drawbacks I face, I am hooked on to my Nexux. I'll get into the cons and workarounds for it: 1. I could not install Whatsapp and Angry Birds Go from Play store - says "This is not compatible with your tablet." Did the workaround and it works like a charm on the tab now. Workaround: a. I downloaded the apps on my Xperia U. b. Installed an app extractor and saved the apk. c. Transferred it to the tab using USB / WiFi transfer. d. Installed it on the tab. 2. It heats up a bit after playing for 2 - 3 hours. 3. Takes time to charge. (Compared to my mobile phone) 4. The USB charging cable is too short. 5. Screen is a finger print magnet.
Owned it for 2 months now, no problems to report what so ever. Works as promised. Latest updates are just too easy to download. Multitasking is a breeze. The biggest downside wold be the lack of a camera. The new Nexus 7 has been equipped with a good camera but not in this price range.
i have a nexus 4 and a nexus 7 now both are awesome both of them are best in thier own field i short listed 4 tabletes which were samsung galazy tab 3 asus fonepad nexus 7 lenovo idea pad but tab 3 was not so good asus fonepad is the worst tablet in this list and seceond last is leneovo idia pad
I only say it's "Awesome Tablet"....B'coz it's performance is Awesome, Buttery backup is Awesome, Gaming is Awesome......Internet speed is also Awesome.... I Love this One..
I don't have a SINGLE complaint. This is truly an awesome product for the price that it is being offered for. Played lots of 1080p movies effortlessly and I was also able to play heavy games like Dead Trigger 2 without any lag at all.
After purchasing this, I stopped using my PC for my regular use at home. With a wi-fi connection, I could do almost everything in my Nexus 7 itself. I'm completely satisfied with Nexus 7 except the fact that you can not exchange data from/to other storage devices using OTG cable without rooting the device. Looks like there is an app using which we can copy data from other devices to Nexus 7 but not vice-verse. Overall I'm very much satisfied with this product.
Great tablet , very light and convenient to hold in hand , the speed is blazing fast. Ideal for gaming , watching videos and as eBook reader.I also use an iPad with retina display , so compared to that , display is a bit inferior but mind you , it is certainly not bad for the price especially videos look fantastic. Using this more than the iPad these days. The packaging was great and fantastic service as always by flipkart, received the product in less than 36 hours after placing the order. Only sad part is bought it for Rs11999 just a week ago and surprised to see the new price tag 10999 :( .Flipkart , can I get a refund of Rs 1000 please... Grab it before the stocks last.
Design failure. Please dont buy looking at the configuration. I bought last month, just after a week I am facing charging problem. If you dont trust me, then please search for Nexus charging problem in google and decide yourself.
Couple of months back I purchased Nexus 7, 32GB wifi modal from Flipkart. As usual the flipkart service was delightful.. The tablet gives a great quality experience for the user, no doubt about it. Accidentally the tablet screen developed a crack which hampered the touch operation but the display worked fine. Called the Asus service center for the touch screen repair and replacement. They quoted Rs.10000/- for the tablet display screen replacement and said the rate is fixed by Asus. As an alternate they even suggested me to buy a new one which would be same price as the replacement cost. It was a real disappointment to hear that from Asus. So my verdict is Nexus 7 is a good tablet for this price range until its not damaged. So handle with care.
Nexus 7 2012 is one of the best tablet available in the market at this price range. On the first day it got updated to 4.3 and on next to 4.4. Performance is awesome. Battery life is good. Playing Games like Asphalt 8, GT Racing, NFS MW, Mortal Combat 4 is butter smooth. In all a Superb Tablet at Superb Price.
The nexus 7 is very small beast ,but if you are used to a big tablet such as the iPad you may find it very small. Overall ,the nexus 7 is the best available tablet for its price. Being a nexus device , it will always get the android updates first. I would recommend this tablet to the people looking for a tablet in this price range.
This product from Google is just great. It may be a little old due to the new introduction of newer products. however, for general use, this product leaves many other similar tabs far behind. At @ Rs. 12,000, Value for money. This, backed up by a efficient and quick delivery by Flipkart ensures a pleasant buying experience.
Hi Guys , Recently i brought this tablet thru flikart . Overall all product health is very good . How ever i found battery backup showing is around 4 hrs . I am not sure , what should be approx backup hrs should be . Can anyone pls help to answer .Note - i am not running any application and battery backup showing 4 hrs around .
Grab it before stocks last. You can't get a 16-core tablet (4-core CPU + 12-core GPU) cheaper than here. Plus, its a Nexus device.. so, you'll get Android updates pushed directly from Google as soon as its available. I got the Android 4.4 KitKat the first day.. :) Its 1 week already since I received the tablet. This week was very rough for it because of initial setup ju-ju... And, it has passed the test. I never experienced a bit of lag even after heavy use & battery backup was great so far. Its Wi-Fi is quicker than that of my Laptop. And, it can play anything at its arsenal.. I am playing Ripetide GP 2 at this time. Don't ignore this just because it doesn't have 3G. Just purchase Huawei Wingle E8131 Data Card for Rs. 2500. Its as big as other 3G dongles but it can give portable Wi-Fi access to your Nexus 7. You just need to give it power with wall socket (no need of PC, drivers etc.) which can also be done with OTG cable attached with Nexus 7.
Well If You Are Thinking Of Buying A Tablet This Is The One. The Price Has Come Down And It Is Pure Android Experience. I Got The Tablet Updated To Android 4.4 And It Work Wonders. I Am Using It For The Past Two Months And It Has Never Let Me Down For Even A Second. Go For It If You Are Looking For Something Different Than Samsung And Apple. The Build Quality And Looks Are Excellent. Just Lacks Rear Camera But Everything Else Is Just Top Notch.
I purchased this through Flipkart 1 month ago for 9499 & honestly man Best decision of my life. This tab is hell lotta fast & better in every aspect. All high end games like- NFS Most wanted, Asphalt 7,8, Modern Combat 3,4, Shadowgun, Amazing Spiderman, Batman runs buttery smooth n while playing games you get over 600mb FREE RAM so performance is just WOW. 2 weeks back KITKAT update as well. Remember this will be updated to 4.2 & Bluetooth wont work. But just update it to latest 4.4 version & it will work. (mine worked with 4.3 update). NO CONS in this product. If you want a TAB just for Gaming ,this is it. Only thing is this TAB wont let you do anything for 1st time unless you connect to Wifi. Buying this tab is like Heaven than purchasing CHEAP SHAMEsung or Micromax phones. 16gb was enough for me.so far i have Asphalt7,8, MC 3,4, NFS Mostwanted, Riptide gp2, Amazing spiderman, Batman, Shadowgun installed. Battery life is also amazing. Non stop gaming for 7-8 hours. Medium use will last for 2 days.
The tab overall features and responsiveness lived up to its expectations. Been wanting to buy one for quite some time now. At 12k, this deal was a steal. I should've given a 5-star rating if the rear camera were also there. Guess I didn't read the specs correctly before ordering, MY bad.
Excellent build and picture quality, easy to use, for this good price. Once connected to wifi, I was easily able to upgrade this device's OS from 4.1 Jelly bean to 4.4 kitkat can be multi used except phone functionality. I'm amazed with it's GPS functionality, you can easily locate you location in real time without wifi. Best campanion while travelling or can be used as car entertainment with GPS and OBD 2 functionality
Only 1 Minus Point Not Back Camera otherwise speed is to good and very smoothly working display was to good
I love the Nexus 7 Tablet that I purchased from Flipkart and I wish they had the latest version available.
This is the best available option for the best price I was worried reading faulty pieces reviews But mine is just awesome :-) No problem regarding the tablet If you are thinking to buy the tab then go for it blindly and trust me you will never regret Enjoying 4.4 kitkat in its purest form :-) Kudos flipkart
i just recieved my nexus 7, and wholla its jus awesome!! the screen unlike i saw in videos or reviews was simply superb. if you are planning to buy one,then just go for it,u will never regret. device is snappy,but max volume itself is low(never matters anyways). fluid in performance backed with great screen quality..worthy investment!!
Before using this tablet I was a user of Samsung galaxy tab 2 P3100. Since the release of this device wanted a unit to use by myself,now the time has come and I'm using this from last saturday. In compare with Tab 2 it's very fast. Currently running 4.3 and hoping it'll get 4.4 update real soon.
I've been using the tablet since yesterday and i m just loving it ... no lag or hang up when playing games ... initially i took some time to update the device ... now running 4.4 android ... so far nothing wrong and using everything possible to find a glitch ... nothing as of now ... so i would say much better tablet compared to samsung or any other in the pricing range ... go for it without thinking much ....
I hv ordered it by debit card on 28 Nov and tablet is delivered on 30th.Packaging was good bt not great.I ws little scared by reading reviews of getting defective product.I received a good product and tablet is working fine and updated to KitKat 4.4.Nexus 7 is very good vfm product nd hardware performance is excellent.Gaming and browsing experiences are also great.Sound quality and eBook reading experiences are also fine.Only thing little annoying me are touchwiz interface and customization as I am a Samsung S3 user.Keeping finger crossed and wishing tablet will b working fine...
It is really a great product to own..:) Its one month now and I'am enjoying it...It will become your best buddy for sure:))
Its very nice tab 32 Gb... Nice Speed Nice Display Not it got 4.4 Update also ... and flipcart given very fast delivery with in 24 hours i got my tab.
One of the best available in market for the price. Even my friends with apple ipad are envious..... Screen resolution is nice. Sound quality is well enough. Good processing power and graphics card. can play all games including fifa 14.....
hello frds i just order this tablet with sbi cash back offer and i will get this product for 10800 and i want to say 1 thing most of the peoples are writing revies like their is no 3g only wifi is their for those ppls if u want to use this tablet with 3g sim u just need to buy (ZTE MF61 4G / 3G usb modem WiFi Wireless 21 mbps Mifi Pocket Router) worth 3000 in ebey... and enjoy the wifi and 2g/3g/4g experiace with dis......... and i got this two items for 10800+3000=13800 thn k u........
With in the specified price bracket, this device is worth of purchasing. I have noticed: 1. Display clarity is very clear 2. Good and nice video playback 3. Good battery backup 4. Faster and real graphics content 5. Feels really good while reading the ebook contents 6. Very handful tab/Personal device 7. Quick availability of the Android updates as it is a pure Google product The device sometime gets heated up when kept on a Plane surface while charging. Its good to charge 100% of the batter while the device is switched off. It increases the battery lifetime. Feeling very satisfied with the device performance.
Had a great experience while using Google Nexus 7 tab.. if you dont require back camera then this tab is best. and i personally feel that paying 11k just for 5 megapixel camera is not a good deal with comparison to Google Nexus 7 (2nd gen)
I have a Google Nexus 7 16 GB bought from Flipkart for Rs. 9K. No doubt the pircing is excellent, display is GREAT, NO LAG, SUPERB for GAMING. But let me BEWARE you before you buy it. Very Poor Wifi Signal. Even poor than any other 5 mobile phones at my home. Gets disconnected very often and unable to catch signal in less than 10 mtrs.. while my mobile phone and laptop wifi shows good signal even at 20 mtrs distance. Still I will rate it 4 star because the product is excellent. I cannot work with this in my Balcony (where I love to sit and browse internet the most) but its all right.. this is as good as any other Rs. 25K Smart phone without a camera and Sim Slot.

man... man...man...this is damn cool... i mean from the moment i bought this... i am only on it.. the quad core processor is a perfect companion of the 1 GB of ram... this is the best tablet... this is specially for gaming... you will never regret about this choice... i have 50 apps and games installed.. but the best part is that it doesn't slow down.. kudos to asus and ya to google...!!!
coming to the tablet it is an awesome buy. This has a perfect form factor and the perfect size. Love playing with it. now coming to the performance the tegra 3 is sizzling and the 12 core gpu is enough for any game on the play store. the display is gorgeous not as good as the new nexus 7 but it is okay as it is a backlit led ips panel. and the sound quality is great actually, i read that it was not great through earphones but if you use good quality earphones(i personally use creative ep-630) and good bitrate audio and video files you'll get good output through headphones all in all a steal at 12,000 rs go buy it!!!
my grandson playing this product very interesting and also learning many rhymes and other primary things thanks to GOOGLE NEXUS 7
Many Thanks to Flipkart Team. As always, Best delivery from Flipkart. It got delivered within 2 days with excellent packing from Seller. Tablet was having some touch screen issues from very beginning. I mailed flipkart about this issue and had a word with them over call, they understood tablet issue right away and shipped replacement table within an hour. Now I got my tablet replaced and it is working flawlessly right now. Great after sales support from Flipkart. No one can match or even come closer to the service of Flipkart. Now coming to the product, it is best available tablet right now in the market. Don't even think about other brands if you want to purchase a tab. Simply go for Nexus 7. Total value for money.
I always wanted to get the nexus phone or tablet. As soon as flipkart dropped the price of this tablet.I snatched it. Got it for 13,000 ...just a week or so before it became 12,000 during diwali sale. With the nexus you never have to worry about the quality. Great specs. Nexus 2013 isn't available in India yet...and paying 10,000 more just for a camera and a slightly better processor doesn't make sense. Go for it till its in stock !!!
Believe me I'm a nexus fan... and I wanted to buy that from a very reliable dealer... I can't find it nearby so I have to search online.... and being a flipkart user how could I go somewhere else... First of all packing is absolutely good... and the product is awesome! the best tablet in market in this price bracket... bought it for 12500 from flipkart a week before Diwali.... it works like charm... looks wise its absolutely amazing.... I remember when I was searching for his case a sop keeper asked me which tab is this....ipad??? it looks that great in hand! performance very good without any lag.... played fifa 14, real football 12, dead trigger,subway surfer,real racing 3, fast and furious 6, FL commando, Contract killer all works like charm... and apps don't crash at all even after having 80 apps (a bunch of photo editing and social networking)... I got the 32gb variant and I am extremely happy to use my first Nexus and my very first tab... :) I'm loving it... thank you flipkart!
do not buy this tablet if u want more just wait for the second genration of nexus 7 which is far more better with android 4.3 and can go 4.4 easily far of gr8 tab!
One of the amazing tablets for the money. You wont require any other tablet. Amazing battery life and you cant live without it.
Have been using over a month, its a very good tablet the cons i found is low saturation of the display, everything else is awesome
the best tablet ever for gaming the only only bad effect is that no back camera and no attachment of sim to it.
It Is A Great Tab..!!! I Always Love To Play on It. But It Had Some Cons - 1. When I Charged It It Become Heat Up Very Fast. 2. Camera Is Very Bad ( Becaz It,s 1.2 MP ) 3. Hd Movies Are Lagging ( Not After Install HD Movie Player ) { Sry 4 My English -_- } But IF U R Planing 2 But Galaxy Tab 3 T311 Then U R In Wrong Side I Had Allredy T311 But I Dont Y I Like Nexus 7 32 Gb Becaz OF its Hardware & Software Also ( Android 4.3 & 4.4 Is Comming Soon In This Year ) Thankyou.
The best 7 inch tablet in the Indian market currently. And I'm just delighted with flipkart's service. I got the tab in a day. Way to go flipkart! You are setting a benchmark!
very nice touch response.runs most apps at ease.it's a WOW product.brilliant luks.nice to hold and use. it has very good sound and a bright screen too
i purchased this tablet few days back from flipkart only, and its working great, no issues, better thn samsung tab3.
This is a good tablet around Rs 10000-12000.Display is very good,Ram and processor are adequate enough to play high end games and do multitasking.Battery lasts for 5 to 6 hours on complete charge.Though it doesn't support SIM, it's a good buy if you don't travel much and can manage with WiFi. As it's stock android there is no lag at all. 32 gb (we get around 27 gb for usage) will be handy as it doesn't support external Sd card. Nexus always gets the latest updates as soon as they launch. Great build quality, Comfortable to hold and do the tasks. This tablet has Nvidia tegra 3 under the hood, so we observe heating issue on the backside while playing games and performing some tasks. Visibility and Readability are good.We can watch videos with great quality and reading ebooks are crisp and clear. Screen is gorilla glass 1 protected, but attracts finger prints. may or may not use screen guard, it's a personal choice The sound is comparatively low, but that will not be a huge concern. Over all no major flaws, decent buy VFM for the price. It supports OTG with some tweaks. Regarding updates, Google supports every device for minimum of 18 months.If it's the case including 4.4 kitKat update it also gets 5.0 update for sure. Tailpiece:Though it's specifications are very much inferior to Nexus 7 (2013) version. At the price of around Rs 10000 this is a best buy no complain tablet.
Value for money product at special price of Flipkart with 15% cash back. Product is great at this price. Good touch, very responsive, good speed, already downloaded more than 70 app but still no leg. however new Nexus 7 is available in market but will cost 5K more but in this price range its best.
Awesome tablet and got at an amazing price at flipkart and as usual great service by flipkart. Instead of buying the Samsung Tabs, I would suggest users to go for this tab, excellent build quality and also you would get the latest updates directly from Google.
Best Tablet in the market..!!! At this price, you cannot get anything better than this. JUST GO for it :)
Faulty Nexus 7 (32) gb ---------------------------------- Just within a couple of days of arriving the tablet, it started giving me nightmares n sleepless nights with ton load of problems like flickering, lagging n all.. Sometimes it took me ages just to turn it on as it used to go into deep sleep. So I updated it to 4.3 jellybean in a hope that all problem would be resolved.. To my expectations, it worked very smoothly for few hours and I would be like relieved as well as so satisfied at the same time but just after few more hours it just went into a deep static mode where the tablet doen't turn on.. Now the scenario is -- No matter what you do but it won't turn on.. I noe flipkart will replace my tablet as per their 30 days policy but to be very frank: It's a series of horrifying nightmares to loose your personal data, photographs and all the apps as well as all your efforts, time and money you put in to secure, configure and customize your tablet. Being a loyal customer I feel sorry to say this but lately, Flipkart's Quality Control is getting worse n worse. The tablet was the third faulty product I received. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First time --- WD 500gb HDD : I got it replaced from Western Digital company but it took me like billion centuries and buttlaod of efforts before the actual replacement. Second time --- a Transcend pendrive was defective. Flipkart got it replaced twice. But the same replaced pendrive was again faulty again and i end up getting Flipkart Credit for the same amount. Third time --- The Nexus 7 i recently bought is faulty. However I tried everything under the sun (including instructions given in Google Support Videos) to make my tablet work as I never wished to loose my personal data, photographs and apps. But unfortunately nothing worked... :( Dear Flipkart, please improve your quality check before dispatching the products as No MATTER HOW LOW YOUR price would be or HOW FAST YOU can deliver but a Customer Expects a proper Product in Working Condition n not a FAULTY One.. Thank you.
First of all thanks for Flipkart for giving such an awesome tab only for 12k and plus delivering it in 2 days time. Coming back to pros and cons of the nexus 7: Pros: 1. Solid build quality - gives a premium feels 2. More than decent battery life. 3. 32 gb of internal memory. 4. Lag free performance. 5. Good for mid-range gaming experience. 6. can run pretty much any application available on play store. 7. Good internet surfing experience. 8. Can play HD video with ease - awesome viewing angles - movie watching is a delight 9. light weight - can easily carry it. 10. Quality of charger and USB cable is premium 11. Keyboard is awesome - large enough for easy typing and plus the swipe feature is handy. 12. OTG feature is also great to have - need to buy the OTG cable separately. Cons: 1. Display quality can be more sharp - Even HD wallpapers look bid dull. 2. speakers are not loud - you need in ear head phone to enjoy music and video. 3. no back camera - even the front camera is not that great. 4. Screen is a finger print magnet - but not a big issue for me personally. 5. No calling facility. 6. No memory card - but you need one 32 gb is enough for daily use and plus you can connect external storage through OTG. Over all it is the best tablet if you are ready to ignore the No calling facility tag and back camera. Real value for money. its better to go shell out the additional 3k for the 32 gb version as there is no memory card support. Go for it guys - its a steal deal!!! I have been enjoying the tablet from 2 months now. Complete Lag free performance.
Best in class .. No voice call facility.. Just go for it. i had used it and find n prob till now .. Display, speed and all things are good battery backup is also good .
its a cool product.. i bougth it for 12349 as special discount offer.... im enjoying it... display quality and battery backup is amazingly awesome...
I am not happy about Nexus 7 while using this product with in 2 min heat is generating and not able to handle. I had received this product from Flip kart they had delivery in 4 days . when i opened the box packing is not good . Coming to application wise its not user friendly and Nexus 7 have the seconday camera( Front side ) it is not useful to any one .I am sincerely advising to all don't go to nexus 7 Tab.
A Big applause to ASUS to provide a Quality tablet that is at par with IPAD 3rd gen for this price. Further with the flipcart discount of 31% and 10% cash back, it was a No brainer to purchase this . A brilliant screen and luxurious feel with a tension free gorilla glass display with IPS Excellent for reading books on the inbuilt PDF viewer. Specially when switched to reading view, where one does not have to zoom and keep moving the page from left to write. A well designed tablet , where cost cutting is don't at the right places when the feature is not needed much. Example no back camera (front is there for video calling), no vibration and no light but Who needs all this when u have a good camera phone. BUT 1 PROBLEM I CAN'T TRANSFER FILES OVER ANDROID BEAM (wifi DIRECT) TO MY NOTE 2 or as of such no other samsung phones like TAB or S3 due to the incompatibility of the android 4.3. It just pairs but does not transfer. 3rd party apps dont help either. A big Let down and i hope Google comes out with a patch soon. However its a great Tablet ! and u would not need a 3G version if you know how to create a hotspot on your phone. Oh yes ! ! This has a very imp GPS sensor thats great when using Sygic or any other navigation system that does not need the internet to run.
Great product at a great price. Good clarity, light weight, good battery back up. Hard to find a good case for this though.
I bought the mighty Google nexus 7 last Saturday from flipkart at a really nice price of 11999/- and will be getting a 1800 rupees Cash back by 30 November. I think that's the cheapest i could have paid for this beast. Got the tab delivered on Tuesday and it has been a really nice experience so far. Pros : 1. Its beautiful, smart and with its rubberized rear, its really easy and smooth to hold. 2. No lag: When i say no lag, i mean it. I have been playing FIFA'14 on this ever since i got this in my hands. And it runs multiple applications together without a lag. 3.Updated Android : As soon as i got this, the system recognized there's an update since i see that the build is around march'2013. My tab now runs on Android 4.3 and is lightening fast. 4. Touch : I have used samsung's tab 2 and the google nexus 7 is like light years ahead of Samsung when it comes to touch. Its a different experience altogether. 5. Display : It has a 7" screen. I have played many Full HD videos and movies and they all run fast. Its a treat to watch them on the tab Cons : Many people would argue that the tab doesn't have a rear camera and that it has no calling facility and no expandable memory. My answer would be: Don't buy a tablet if you want all that. Buy a cellphone,rather :) Overall, a really nice buy! Pretty happy with my decision.
I had used Nexus 7 wifi earlier and now with this 3G Nexus 7 is awesome. Too fast and user friendly Tab. Thanks Flipkart for bringing such good deal on this product.
Flipkart - Your business is really professional. The site is very well designed. Good offers. Gifted "Google Nexus 7 32 GB" to my niece for her 3rd birthday :) She is happy. Looks like its working fine without any issues so far. Hope it stays like that forever until she kicks it. My sister told me that the gift packaging was good and it just went with my wordings, had a nice feel. Was delayed by a day (4 days -> 5 days) to Chennai. Luckily I had ordered a week before her birthday. I feel 16GB is value for money and worth buying but I bought 32GB as I can download some animation movies/cartoons for her to save it to the tab and hence more space. Considered Samsung 7" tab but it wasn't worth that price honestly. Samsung needs to learn a lesson or two. IPAD mini is already launched with Retina display. Lets wait and watch the price. Anyways, it will sell like crazy with their fans queuing for a day :p Nexus price will further come down. Is the new version in already? Flipkart, keep up the good work. I will definitely consider buying stuffs from here. This is my first online purchase on a online shopping portal :)
Fantastic product for the current price. Product Quality of Google coupled with the ever awesome Flipkart service was fantastic. Got my tablet within 48 hrs. Though the new generation Nexus 7 might soon get launched, it is sure to be priced close to 20k. So, no concerns regarding the purchase of older generation Nexus 7. Go for it. You won't regret. !!!
First I would like to write about the product. Guys if your budget is around 10 k for a tablet go for it. U won't get any better tablet than this. If ur wallet permits pay another 10 k for nexus 7 2013. Pros. 1.great HD screen. 2. No lags even playing high HD games like modern combat 4. 3.we can connect pendrive or harddisk through an app called nexus media importer.so problem of not having SD card slot solved. 4. Super touch experience. Con's. 1. Its a fingerprint magnet. Don't compare it with Samsung tab 2 or 3 its far better than these tabs. Not to forget great pricing from flipkart and it reached within 48 hours from my ordered time.totally superb..
Awesome experience.. Display is very good (LCD HD) Touch Sensitivity is very good Great experience when doing gaming, no lagging.
[+]: >The quality and stability of the software along with the buttery smooth UI are just unbelievable, it's pure Google beauty that you get to enjoy only with a nexus after all ! >The price truly makes it a steal over here, Google's subsidy makes it ultra-competitive, virtually there's no tablet which gives this good value for money. >Screen Size: I used an iPad 2 prior to this and believe me the handy 7 inch size and lesser weight is a relief ! [-]: >If you're coming from a high resolution display phone/tablet you might find it a little bit of a strain. >No headphones (i.e. if you're looking forward to them, else it's fine) --Disclosure: I'm not an avid gamer, so I can't say about the gaming performance, although I did try subway surfer and it worked flawlessly, but can't comment on high end games. Ordered this during the flat Rs.1000 off period along with 15% cashback, sweetest deal from flipkart ! Service was great as usual, delivered in exactly 60 hours from time of placing order.
I was surprised when i received the order at my home. I placed an order on 20th 12:05am, and i had the tablet at my doorstep at 21st 11:30am. (even though 20th was sunday) The packing was really the best i have ever seen with very good care taken to the packaging to make sure no damage was made. So 5/5 to Flipkart for making it possible, also it was a awesome great diwali deal, couldn't resist the price offer, and i bought it. ---- Now regarding the product, i did a lot of research before buying the product, i know that this is the 1st gen, and the 2nd gen is already released and a lot better in terms of memory, processor, camera, and other aspects, but seeing this great deal with about 41% discount, i bought it no-matter what. You cant get anything better for the 12K price, no other tablet matches this. lus you get vanilla android with the latest updates instantly. I started my tablet, and within few minutes the 4.3 android was available for me to install. And im sure this table will also be getting the KitKat version too as soon as its released. Great Product. Cannot complain anything about it.
Touch is smooth. . Performance is very good espesically during games like Temple Run. No hanging problem since i received. Overall a good product.
Nexus 7 osam I like the most is the display any angel you can view it .. Processor speed amazing EA football 2014 works osam in it.
Received the Nexus 7 in a well packed manner. The Only hiccup was the it would not Turn ON immediately as the battery had no juice at all. I had charged for about an hour after which it turned on. For a 7 inch tablet for this price you would never get a better one.
Got it from flipkart for 12.35 K two weeks back... the tablet is absolutely brilliant for gaming and entertainment. The 16 GB model priced at 9 K is more value for money than this. However I went for 32 GB model as I wanted to store many HD video songs. Got it delivered by flipkart in 24 hrs. This is a tablet I was wanting to buy last year. And at this price it makes sense to grab this. The new nexus 2013 will be mostly priced close to 20 K for 32 GB model. After all this is just an entertainment device and I feel not like spending too much for such a device waiting for the new model... So, at this price the buy is completely justified :)
Planning to buy this. I am planning to buy this tab. Can some one pls confirm: 1. Can we use SIM in this. 2. Is whatsapp supported, if no then does any one know the reason. 3. It appears that it does not have camera. Any other cons.
There is not a better tablet at this price in this world. I have used it for couple of weeks and I have already kept my ipad aside in my cupboard. I was rooting for NEXUS 7 2nd GEN but let me tell you guys it won't come before JAN. And the price of 32 GB won't be any less than 22,000 . So guys buy this or wait for another 3 months to get the 2nd version for double the price. And yes I got it for 12,350 Reasons u need to seriously buy this- 1) It is the cheapest A NEXUS will ever go 2) Best for gaming . This 7 inch monster is even better than my IPAD 3 because of its size and its perfect balance in my hand. Let me tell u this I have played NOVA 3, FIFA 14, ASPHALT 8, REAL RACING 3, REAL FOOTBALL, IRONMAN 3. These games are all above 1 GB. I am a hardcore gamer and when i tell u its good, it really is good. 3)1000 Times better than GALAXY tab3 or 2 or any available model. My friend has it and I have compared it thoroughly. 4) Preety good screen resolution (again better than galaxy tab and ipad mini) 5) Excellent Processor (it just stops at nothing - 2 heavy games , 1 pendrive attached , 1 1080p video playing, Play Store open) 6) Support External Pendrive - so don't be worried about storage(just use an OTG Cable) 7) Sleek good back surface for holding in hand and yes its light weight too 8) U get Latest versions of ANDROID as soon as they are launched. - I am waiting for my KITKAT to be released.
While buying it I thought.... would it b good???? Because I bought it just by seeing the reviews....... But after experiencing it my emotions were just WOW...!!!!!!!
Got the Tab within 48 hrs of ordering. Good Packing. Nexus Brand offers the Best Hardware out there and Flipkart gave it for Best Price. Very Good Buy.
This tab is an excellent choice at this price point. Even though the updated version is going to come soon however this tab does not lack anything.
got my nexus 7 today . working great.. awesome tablet at this price . Initially I had some trouble with my android 4.3 update. It went upto almost 20% and got stuck there for a while. Thankfully it got corrected by itself. All I got to say is that , this tab is worth every penny u spend !
Nexus 7 has proved to be nothing but an item of luxary to me. The 7" screen isn't as vibrant as other Super AMOLEDs, but it's good enough. It's hard to locate pixels. Speaker is very good with MX Player. The body really feels premium. There is no app for camera; front camera is only used in video calling I could catch occassional lag, but in considerable amount. Games run smoothly though. Reading with Play Books feel fantastic. I got pre-loaded with Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean), and swiftly updated it to Android 4.3. So far only one bug noticed! As for the battery life, at low brightness and moderate use it drops 8-10% per hour. It's the purest Google Android, I have ever felt.
I received this tab in flat 2 days. Ordered on Sat evening and received on Mon. Tablet is excellent. Fast, responsive and sufficient storage. built quality could have been better. Camera should have been in the back instead but it doesn't matter (tabs are not used to click pics). There is hardly any lag while playing FIFA 14. I got additional 5% discount (Navratri). Flipkart is reliable.
First i should thank flipkart for its delivery . i actually bought this product as a gift to my cousin who is 8 years old,particularly for games The best choice is go for the same in 16GB variant,its worth. Even after downloading major games like 1.Real Racing 3 game data of 1GB 2.GTA vice city 3.Need for speed most wanted and many more popular games also with some of his favorite Videos nearly around 2GB but still device is having 23GB free memory,whereas the usable is around 29 when android OS is upgraded to 4.3. pretty decent device but its getting heated (it gets heated only after a continuous use of more than 40 minutes) battery is good but its taking more time to charge. also i need to tell u there is not even a single lag experienced till now. my cousin could not keep this device away from him as he is using nearly 10 hours a day on weekends.
itz a gr8 tablet n available at d best cost on flipkart... overall m v.happy wid d tab as well as flipkart :)
I bought this tablet after the recent price drop, and it is a steal at this price. Buttery smooth performance for all tasks, a brilliant screen and awesome battery life make this device a pleasure to own.
got mine just now.. on 7th Oct13. got to me just in 2 days .. thnx to Flipkarts Ekart service. Power,Looks, everything is fantastic on this tab.simply loving it. deserving 5stars cos lets face it.. you cant get this package in 10k mark. :)
Recieved the tab on 2nd day... Fell in love with flipkart.. Nice packaging... Bought it for 12350 on 4th October. .. Till now no issues other than the screen looks washed out. Though its not flipkart's fault.. I searched the web and found that itsthe problem with nexus 7 2012... So no complaints.. I am a serious gamer and believe me its bang for the buck.. Real football, fifa14, dead trigger, FL commando, contract killer, nfs most wanted, each and every game played pretty nicely.. no lag whatso ever.. and the reading experience is also fantastic.. high ppi density.. Overall pretty nice product.. Seriously recommending everyone to buy it....
Just bought the Nexus 7 32gb wifi one. At 12.5k, the tablet is a steal. Performance is very good. No lag, You can load it with plenty of applications without any issue. The display is brilliant, as good as Galaxy Tab 3 (might be even better). You wont find any other STANDARD brand selling a 1GB ram tablet with a QUADCORE processor at this PRICE RANGE with Jelly Bean 4.3 running smoothly. Though there is no back camera, the FRONT camera is sufficient for Video Chat. Even though, it is practically useless for anyone who doesn't have a wifi connection,the fact is if you have Wired internet connection at home, i would recommend getting a D-Link wired router for about 900rs and connecting this device via wifi
best quality, on time(acc. before time:D) and wat can i say?,,,,its awesome....got 4.2 out of box n its android 4.3 am really really appie :D
I bought a 32GB version for 13,500 from flipkart, and only 3 days later found price dropped to 13,000. Obviously, was very disappointed but the 4th day i opened my mail and found a flipkart mail refunding me 500 bucks for my nexus purchase. my happiness was beyond imagination. Fell in love with flipkart after this generous act. About tab, one word would suffice it - awesome. lag free gaming, gorgeous screen and big battery what more can a fellow ask. Great deal on flipkart. just go for it!!
The tablet is sleek and powerful and is definitely worth the money. It has a good processor, a good internal storage size and a good display. The only shortcoming I found was that the tablet does not has a rare camera. Also it would be great if Asus provides earphones along with it. The service of flipkart was also within time and prompt.

I got the Google nexus 7 two days ago and Flipkart service was fantastic, i got the n7 within 2 days. Now coming to the product, Since this is a google product. There is no need to wait for updates. As we know updates are really essential in getting the maximum performance of your device. As soon as i connected to wifi i got the notification for latest 4.3 update. The device is now more smoother than previous jelly bean version. The 4325 mah Battery easily last for a day with a usage of 6hrs+ screen on time Which includes gaming and HD movie playback. Now coming to the graphics, Nvidia Tegra 3 relly does the job. Gaming is totally awesome, one can also tell this a gaming tablet. People who want to play HD games in full graphics. Just buy this one.I tested some high graphics graphics like Asphalt 8, Ganstar Vegas, Gangstar Rio, Dungeon Hunter, Riptide 2 every game was maxed out and there was no lags. Multitasking is so fast due to 1GB ram. People who own this device can forget the word lagging. So finally this device really stands out for the price. People whose budget is more say around 25k, then you can wait and go for the nexus 2013. But for now a 32GB storage with all the other mighty features at a price of 13999 is a really a heavenly offer. Thanks to Flipkart.
pl. dont purchase it. the newer version of it would be available in india by the last quarter of the year and the newer version is just awesome got it from one of my cousin from U.S. it has double ppi double resolution display double RAM double battery backup and moreover it costs only a bit higher feom the 2012 version. check on amazon if u dont believe..!! wait and get the better one for the same price
Nexus 7 is the best tab you can find. But 2nd Gen Nexus 7 Tabs are on the way....so, better wait for those!! :D Happy shopping...Flipkart is good! ________________________________________________________________
in next coming weeks nexus 2013 version in going to launch in india which is 80% faster than this version n have more better features than this version.but the biggest problem with nexus tablets in india is their unrepairability.I m eagerly waiting to buy its 2013 version but do anyone thought what if nexus 7 starts troubling when it goes out of warranty such as its display screen or digitiser,battery or charger as there is no official nexus 7 parts avaible in india so how to get it repaired if its display screen gets cracked or it starts troubling when its out of warranty.so till one year we have no tension becuase of having secured waranty but after 1 year when warranty goes off n then if nexus tablet evr troubles then how to get it repaired due to its repair parts lackness
Amzing1 Amazing ! Amazing! Flipkart rocks....At this price the best tablet and..has all the features of a high end tablet. quad core device and comes wid nVidia Tegra chipset. Key Point: BEst Price in Market
Where is V2 (2013 Edition), this is the V1 - but not bad. Does the OS receive any updates. Does it allow patched apps to bypass and How is the battery life in practical aspects. Wished in this late release for Indian Customers, they would have added the memory expandability with tweaked Tegra 3 Chipset. Cellular ?
I would request you customers not to buy this nexus 7 tablet, as it will be discontinued from the market soon , because of the l;launch of the new version of nexus 7 . If possible have patience and ait for some time and get the nexus 7 - 2 . Which has been launched in July 201
My best gadget buddy up till now.... Feel proud to be owner of such a device.... If u planning to buy.... Take it..... Let me also let u know nexus 7 II is on its way also so if u can wait Check out the new one....
Good product at reasonable pricing. Some earlier batches of the tablet(2012),may have screen flicker/casing creak issues but Asus has them covered via international warranty. Coming from the iOS club,must say i'm quite impressed with stock 4.3 JB & overall responsiveness of the tablet. If you need greater control & external storage access etc. then Root. (i.e. add a 3G USB dongle if need to access emails on the move) 7" perfect size for eBooks,browsing & emailing,etc. Extremely portable & light. Get a small keyboard + case, if you do some productive computing like Excel & Word edits while on the move. I found it slightly laggy (Android's scrolling physics) & the colours seem slightly washed out. Battery life is good & if you have tons of multimedia files then choose the 32 GB model. Overall a pleasant experience. PS: flipKart pricing may seem slightly higher but replacements are without questions & quickly implemented. Their Customer Care is getting sloppy on follow up & packaging is sometimes shoddy, but they take feedback seriously & have promised to restore their previous glory :)
in about 15 days d 2nd gen of dis tablet will b launched which is far more better than dis n also cheaper,so guys just wait n get a greater tab really a great tab fantastic tablet from google. hope dis helped
Nexus 7 is available on google site itself. take a look at this and save ur money. its a good product from google. you need google wallet account to buy this from google play store. visit google play store then look for device section.
This is amazing device in that price range. I have used iPad and clarity and responsiveness of the device is no more different than it. High Pixel Density makes UI crystal clear. Fast Quad-core Tegra CPU gives it fluent functioning. Played games with heavy graphics and effects and they run smoothly with all effects visible. Sound quality is superb, though not much louder, it's enough. Standards of the Google in the device gives no need to double think. I would say, if you have that budget range, must go for it, rather than iPad mini or others or even iPad.
First of all, it is a nexus device so you are going to get OTA updates, i.e When any new android version comes out, you will get that update within 2-3 days which can be installed within the device itself with a single tap, no other software needed like you install apps. Android 4.3 update is already available to install . Also, you can install Ubuntu OS upon it using the images available for them at the official website of Ubuntu. It won't affect Your android OS as it can boot separately. Second thing, the hardware is excellent and much better than Galaxy Tabs, the Quad core processor and GPU makes it run butter smooth. There is no lag at all even during multitasking unlike Galaxy tabs which turns into lagdroid. Third thing, Looks are stunning the thickness is just perfect and the build quality is the best you can get, you can compare it with the build quality of apple i-pod touch . Also, the screen is scratch-proof so you don't need a scratch guard for it, if you want to avoid finger prints then buy a matty one. IPS panel screen doesn't turn color into negative shades when tilted owing to viewing angles upto 178 degrees. Fourth, the OS android 4.2 which is apparently 4.3 with an update is stock one, means you get vanilla UI ,the default Android UI and unlike other Bloated User Interfaces it is clean and smooth, you don't get any frame-skips while using it, transitions are smooth. Lack of back camera and expandable slot might bother some people, but that could be managed depending upon once needs, Nexus 7 2nd gen might have one but that will be expensive than this one though. it will be coming on 28 August in US, so you will have to wait till Mid September to get in india. As stated by me it would be costlier by atleast 3-4k due to higher specs. IMO if you want to get best of android , can manage without a back cam, Click on BUY NOW button without a second thought .
this tablet is not good and very expensive. there are many other tablets better than this one with better features and less expensive. please do not buy this ever. you can try other tablets. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
So, I got this for myself and my sister, and this is awesome! Every game works, the screen is big enough, but not too big. The pixels are so bright, it gives the illusion of having density comparable to the Galaxy S4 or HTC One. It runs Jelly Bean out of the box, it's the first to get any update, and can easily be rooted/bootloader unlocked/any other modification you can think of. However, the thing does have problems. The battery doesn't work for more than 7-8 hours. This may not be an issue for me, but it probably will be for anybody expecting full portability. Also, it has no microSD slot. That means no matter what you want, you'll never get more than what comes inside. Other than these two problems, this is a great buy, for tinkerers and public alike.
Pros: Nice processor 1.3 Ghz Quadcore ( my rating 4.6 /5) Performance s better while comparing with Samsung Tab 2 ( my rating 4.8 /5) Best resolution while comparing with Samsung Tab 2 ( my rating 4.6 /5) Scratchless display ( my rating 4.4 /5) latest version of android 4.2.2 Best battery life while compare with other tablets ( almost 10hr) ( my rating 4.7 /5) front cam is nice ( my rating 4 /5) Cons: No call facility(I think no one use tab for CALLING,if u need to call,use an app which can call with ur tab while mob and tab is in wifi network) no back cam (i think its not a problm,no one use it for taking photos) The cons are not valid.So i prefer this tab to everyone rather than any other tab in this price range
Bought the 32GB N7 (Wi-fi) for 19K last week and I am telling you it's the best 7" Tablet. Tegra 3 Quad Core Processer with Geforce ULP GPU can beat the sh*t out of those high end gadgets out there. The display is crisp, it has a higher pixel density than those Galaxy tablets. What else do you need? Btw, If you are looking for a tablet to take photographs then you are on the wrong page.
Swayam bought this product but he create confused. He just say "WiFI + 3g point right". Here is the actual detail. In India You can bought Asus Nexus (this) , 2. Amazon Kindle HD. 3. Samsung tablet. All other from Sony and other brand are come at very big cost or cheaper quality product. Don't be confused with company like Micromax, Iball, and some other. All of them made their product in China. You can't expect more then 3 year life from those cheap china product. All 3 consider product have some different. For best product I suggest people to go with Amazon HD. The reason is about Better pixel-density and in comparison you can figure out that they have better thing at the price people gave something less. This one (asus) have good quality. Why not you look at Youtube before bought one. Youtube show the product when people trying to fake the feature.
The Galaxy Nexus 7 Tab is an extraordinary device in many ways and has been launched in india by google in april 2013. Its 16 gb version is available on google play, while the 32 gb and 32 gb with gsm are internationally available. Key Features ITS ANDROID :- google's Android is well known for its user friendly approach and what's a better device than Google Nexus 7. It comes with out of the box 4.1 jellybean and has online upgrades provided by google making it most updated(Now 4.2.2 is available). Tegra 3:- It has tegra 3 T30 1.3 Ghz quad core with nvidia ULP GPU (12 core). This mean it has all the firepower for the best and most demanding games in android market effortlessly. Tegra 3 uses THD version of games which are different (Better and stable) from normal ones. In comparison to Mali 400 (8 core) its better in performance and has low power consumption, meaning longer battery life. Memory:- It has 1 Gb ddr3 ram with 16/32 gb internal memory depending on version u buy with NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY OR USB SLOTS. Networking :- It has wifi and has NO DONGLE SUPPORT. Display :- The display is nice but not exception with lower colour saturation and brightness than say AMOLED screens. Still great for the price. Rooters:- Its ideal for people who like to root and change roms as its a very popular device having thosusands of roms and rooted apps available in addition to google updates. Price:- Its decently price and a great value for money with its built quality and performance. Sound:- has good Audio quality on speakers but NOT SO GREAT with earphones. Customer care:- 1 year limited warranty. If bought from Google play u get GOOGLE Support. Else u have to go to ASUSTEK the manufacturer. Final Verdict :- For non-techies it still dishes a gr8 experience with its high performance and quality. Its very attractively designed and light in weight. Its perfect for techies and gamers and they simply cant ask for more than this at this price. The only turnoffs are non expandable memory and no calling facility(except the gsm version) though my personal fav is 16GB one. Its not called BEST OF GOOGLE for no reason.
pros: looong battery life touch sensitivity is too good cons: if battery dried out, then the screen will start flashing, when you connect to charger, you will not know what is happening for 2,3 days - black out NO USB, NO MEMORY CARD, NO SIM CARD... so, pls stop comparing with samsung p3100 or..., i feel samsung is a good choice...
This is THE best gadget you can treat yourself with, at this budget. It has awesome specs and reviews tell the reality. Its Competition is with Samsung Tab 2 P3110 (16 GB WiFi Only Model) However the samsung tab is available at around 9,000 INR but it has its downsides 1. Dual Core processor (Nexus has Quad Core) 2. TouchWiz UI (Nexus has Stock(pure) Android ) 3. Cheap Build quality (Nexus has premium build quality) 4. 16 GB Space(Nexus 7 32GB).. and many more... Google Nexus 7 Actually Rocks !
really great specs for the price . gaming is such a charm in the device .the pricing of flipkart is same as that of play store but dont know why only the 32 gb version is available here pesonally i love to have the 16 gb version hoping htat it will be available soon in flipkart .........
great product.. @amal right bro the 16 gb version offers more value for money ...waiting for the 16 gb version .this one is great too (didnt has one youtubing knowledge ) i tried the play store to buy it but it wont accept my debit card . so i hav to wait for flipkart
. really great compared to galaxy tab ... a small rooting will gave you access to 3g usb stick as well . but an extra 3000 for 16 gb is really awful. i personally prefer the 16 gb version hope it will be available in the flipkart soon .... my bro is eagerly waiting for thatttt
its a very good deal for the price. One of my frnd had one,far better compared to galaxy tab p3100 . The price in play store is almost similar but flipkart should avail the 16 gb also which offers more value for money and dont worry about the storage usb streaming is great in n7 (may need rooting ). In total the tab is a great experiance but the 16 gb one could hav been more better considering value for money
