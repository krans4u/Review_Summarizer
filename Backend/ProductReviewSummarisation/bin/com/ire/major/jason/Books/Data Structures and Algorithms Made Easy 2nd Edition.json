{"knowledge":{"posr1":"This book was a very good one that helps both pros and freshers with good knowledge on algorithms and data structures. The language is easy to understand and examples are explained in detail. For those who aspire to get recruited into companies like Google,Microsoft,Amazon etc this book will be very helpful.","negr1":"Content is precise and Approach is logical......Rest up-to reader..... Writer have tough knowledge of Interview questions.....","negative":1,"positive":1},"solutions":{"posr1":"This is the real useful book for campus placements. All companies visiting our colleges are asking questions from this book only. It is worth reading and spend time on it. The problems and solutions are really logical and useful.","positive":1},"complexity":{"posr1":"If you are an engineering student ,this is the must have book for u. problems are best explained and solved with different complexity. Most of the algorithm based questions asked in technical interviews are explained in this book. So whether u are a Gate aspirant or looking for a technical job,just go for it","posr2":"This book is really too good and helps to wrap command on Data structure and Algorithms. I read DS & Algo from many books and finally I chose this book that has maximum numbers of example and helps to think in many directions. One single problem has been explained with multiple solutions with different complexity that helps to understand the algo. in more better way.","positive":2},"theory":{"posr1":"If you want a detailed theory of the subject, this book is not of much use. A large number of algorithmic questions present though lacks proper explanation at places. Standard set of questions usually asked in interviews are present in there with solutions.","positive":1},"understanding":{"posr1":"Perfect for interview preparation for Data Structure and Algorithm. Lots of problem to make your understanding more clear. I will say this is must buy for Data structure and Algorithm.","positive":1},"interviews":{"posr1":"If you are an engineering student ,this is the must have book for u. problems are best explained and solved with different complexity. Most of the algorithm based questions asked in technical interviews are explained in this book. So whether u are a Gate aspirant or looking for a technical job,just go for it","posr2":"really a nice book that every student should read before attending technical interviews...this book covers many advanced data structures...explanation given in the book is also very clear esp for run time calculation...thanks for providing such a good data structure book...","positive":2},"basics":{"negr1":"Lucidly written basics and wide variety of problems makes it a must read for anyone who want to hone their algorithmic skills. The explanations given for each and every problem are really a treat. This book also covers theoretical concepts of complexity classes in its own concise way which will be useful for those students wanting to pursue higher studies yet scared by notational jargon of theoretical computer science.","negative":1},"question":{"posr1":"This is a very good book for placement preparation. Content of this book is excellent. Precisely it is a collection of standard interview question. I liked it most. Explanation is given very well. Overall this book is good. This book is helpful to both CS and non- CS guy.","positive":1},"algorithms":{"posr1":"Author explores all the topics from data structures to algorithm design techniques in lucid style. Book is very good for beginners & interview preparation as author discuss famous algorithms asked in coding interviews. for those who find CLRS difficult this book can give a firm base in short time before you move to advanced topics & problems in CLRS. Only shortcoming of the book is no unsolved problems.","posr2":"if u r comfortable with basic data structure and algo..then this is the best book to enhance ur approach and ability for writing efficient algorithms.......","positive":4},"logics":{"posr1":"If You want to improve the way of thinking for programming problems then without any fear refer this book. excellent logics. specially problems with different complexity solution. Thanks ~Regards Manish Kumar","positive":1},"structure":{"posr1":"Book content covers almost all topics, language is genuine, easy to understand. if you want to learn data structure & algo then you must have read this book ... :)","posr2":"if u r comfortable with basic data structure and algo..then this is the best book to enhance ur approach and ability for writing efficient algorithms.......","positive":2},"explanation":{"posr1":"really a nice book that every student should read before attending technical interviews...this book covers many advanced data structures...explanation given in the book is also very clear esp for run time calculation...thanks for providing such a good data structure book...","posr2":"I have gone through this book and I liked it because it has wide variety of problem solving approaches with detailed explanation of Space & time complexity. I would say this book gives you wider understanding of solving the problems. This is a good asset to have while preparing for interviews. Thanks to Narasimha for consolidating !","positive":3},"styles":{"posr1":"This buk is: - nyc - awesome - solved problems - complexities calculation easily explained - good for Btech, Mtech as well as Interviews and Company Professionals. - Helpful for GATE xam. - Lots of programs made wid different styles and comparisons of them! \\m/","positive":1},"logic":{"negr1":"Guys don't go for this book because neither it contains any question which will prepare you for the companies like google amazon.Most dumb logic are provided in the book instead go for Cracking The Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions And Solutions (Paperback) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.If there was a rating less than 1 ,I would have gone for it.","negative":1},"presentation":{"posr1":"This is one of best books I have seen so far in this area. Straight to the point and yet powerful presentation with loads of examples. That makes this book unique among all. I recommend this to all professionals/students to gain knowledge of problems presented in this book.","positive":1},"language":{"posr1":"This books explains everything in a very lucid language and follows a very systematic approach to make u understand. I would suggest this book must be the first book u read. This book explains every concept in detail. Don't get misled by cover page though the cover page is very bad, book is complete contrast to it ............ Gr8 book go for it without any second thought ..................","posr2":"This book was a very good one that helps both pros and freshers with good knowledge on algorithms and data structures.
