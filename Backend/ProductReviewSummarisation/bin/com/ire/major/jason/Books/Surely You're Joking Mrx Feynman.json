{"Physicist":{"posr1":"Overpowering & awesome. Enjoyed reading about one of the greatest Theoretical Physicist of 20th century...written eloquently in his own lively way. He expressed his life inside out.","positive":1},"curiosity":{"posr1":"An excellent book on the adventures and misadventures of one of the greatest scientists of the yesteryears, who, as mentioned in this book, was also a safe cracker, a bar goer, a skeptic, with endless curiosity, a jovial guy, a genius, and ..ooh i am running short of words. I must say, a very 'feyn' book. Go for it.","positive":1},"insight":{"posr1":"This book gives you a deep insight of genius. Really, Feynmann was a magician! You are surprised at every page after knowing his adventures. Truly, he left no room to believe that he was not a \"TRUE SCIENCE MAGICIAN\". Really, the book in my hand delivered to me by flipkart.com is a \"MASTERPIECE\" indeed!","positive":1},"science":{"posr1":"Well Mr. Abhi, first of all you need to know that this book is not supposed be a popular science book. It is simply the stories of Feynman's life. And second of all, from your writing it is quite clear that you don't know or haven't read anything else about Feynman (if you have then its even worse). So keep those dumb opinions to yourself.","negr1":"To be precise to the point.. It will be a much more great and exciting read for people who have some curiosity about scientists and their way of life.. There is very little actual science spoken about.. And the book is full of amusing and diverse experiences that Mr. Feynman has encountered in his scientific career and in his life.. Verdict : Thoroughly Enjoyable","negative":1,"positive":1},"instants":{"negr1":"The book describes the adventures of Mr. Feynman. It narrate the various instants happen in Feynman life.","negative":1}}
