Leaving the pricing the laptop is the best in build quality and configs.Brilliant screen and amazing processor.WS Retail please we are not fools price this laptop better.","positive":1},"adapter":{"negr1":"This notebook has great specs & works like a charm. Only let down is that there is no SSD or mini-SSD card which could have really complemented the hardware. Also, wanted to buy a spare power adapter for home to avoid carrying the supplied power adapter but the same is not available with HP India. This is serious as if the original supplied one gets damaged, there is no ready replacement available.","negative":1},"memory":{"negr1":"Delivery within 20 hours that too on sunday. awsomeee...:) Always great service from flpkart.... i havent used this product as today only it got delivered. but one thing to say u can't get nething better than this..... latest processor huge memory great graphics.... jus one word... awsomeeee:)","negative":1},"booting":{"posr1":"Never go for hp with original window mainly windows 8 and 8.1, when u have to install any other operating system with it like linux based operating sysyems ubuntu, backtrack. it faces the problem of boot loader. it does not easily shows the boot menu. for dual booting you have to try a lot to make it working and i am still trying to overcome it..........","positive":1}}
