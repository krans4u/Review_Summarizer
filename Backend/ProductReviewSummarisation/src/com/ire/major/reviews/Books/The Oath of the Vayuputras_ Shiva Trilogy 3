The Oath of the Vayuputras_ Shiva Trilogy 3@@@it was an immense pleasure to go through the last part of shiva triology ........wonderful!!!!!!!! i have bought all the version from flipcart and i really look forward in the future too for ordering books and other stuufs via flipcart it really makes life easy...
The book unveils everything in the first 100 pages and then drags for 400 pages, simply the book is made huge. Did not like the ending of the book, hence 2 stars, overall for series 3.5 star. Most important is flipkart is cheating people, i ordered all 3 books, and the total crossed 500 but they charged me 120 for delivery charges, when i asked they told 2 books are from other retailer and the first book from another. Hence the book series was split to make 530 amount to 650, a big thumbs down to flipkart.
I got Goose Bums while reading every word of it. Awesome work done by Amish and looking forward for More like this......
it was interesting narrative type story of ancient india with lord shiva as a hero....!! it was interesting narrative type story of ancient india with lord shiva as a hero....!! it was interesting narrative type story of ancient india with lord shiva as a hero....!! it was interesting narrative type story of ancient india with lord shiva as a hero....!!
this is one of my most precious collection. initially i had bought the 1st two books (immortals of meluha and the secret of the nagas) and had read the 1st book within 3 days..(its just unputdownable) but after that i didn't read the book and waited for the third installment..after i got all 3 in my hands, within 5days i completed reading (and rereading the 1st part).. the 3rd book is just the way it should have been. some of the descriptions are so realistic that it feels like as if you can see whats happening in front of our eyes.. a must read for those who have not yet read it..
best books series I have ever own A MUST READ MATERIAL . . . Legendary story, thrilling Suspense, Breadth struck book
fantastic finish....very well crafted sory.....edge of the seat stuff from amish.....kudos.....he is on the way of becoming next big writer of India
Good read. All the characters have been bound together beautifully. Gives the readers a different perspective on the characters.
I love the packing and book received on time with good quality. Just regret that I can get the same order in few more less amount if I would have wait more :) Still I'm happy happy.
Though the evil has been declared as the SOMRAS at the start of the book itself, the course of event described later could be boring and pointless at some instatnces
Its really a good fiction which nearly coinsides with the mythelogical story, u can learn some science, philosophy and love.
Nice Story..well visualized..gets little predictable in the end...Otherwise well told and conceptualized..
I simply stop reading any other book for a week or so as I was still in the thoughts. The presentation of Amish was amazing I red all the books with in a week as I can't able to do any works with out completing them. As usual flipkart at its best in delivery.
I must confess that I am extremely disappointed by what could have been a magnificent end to a great story. In terms of rating, the first book (Immortals of Meluha) was the best and the second book (The Secret of a Nagas) somewhat less interesting than the first book but still interesting nonetheless. II was expecting the same momentum to continue in the third book but to my utter dismay, it turned out to be a torture. Spoiler Alert: The book starts out by a lengthy diatribe about good and evil and how both of them should co-exist etc. etc. blah blah to such an extent that I was like "Ok. I got the hint. Lets get on with the story." Some of the battle scenes are good but the ending tuned out to be quite tame. I was expecting a huge and bloody battle between Meluha's army and Shiva's forces, what with the unexpected twist of Sati's death by assassins hired by her father. But the ending just fizzles out and does not justify the huge build up to the third book (The forces of evil are gathering etc. etc.). Overall, a disappointing end to what could have been a fitting conclusion of a great trilogy. Despite the negative points I must congratulate Mr. Amish for bringing Shiva closer into our hearts and Mind and entertaining us nicely in the first two books. Kudos !! Here's hoping for your next book.
The author has done a commendable job. There is a pace in his writing and is going to keep you glued to the books. Although I like the way Amish has tried to logically define the mythological characters but he has failed to impress me with the ending.
Yes this is the Final of the trilogy and no wonder keeps yo gripping... Again well written and simple to understand...
The final part of Shiva Trilogy read was little slow..only bcause i dint want it to end! Looking forward to Amish's next work on mythology.
After quite a long gap of reading Chetan Bhagath's and a few Tamil novels, i got to read the Trilogy.. I was skeptical if this would go with my taste of read and after a few pages with the Immortals of Meluha and the following two books, i'm glued to the trilogy. On book #3 now. The discount from flipkart is an added plus.
this book gives quite exitement to read more and more about the story but story was hurried at the end
This one is worth reading. The end is not that great, more of a Bollywood style, but still kept engaged till last. The last few chapters were little disappointing but nevertheless a GOOD READ!
magnificent story telling. what gripping. ! it remains with you for some time after you finish it reading.
This is book make me greedy for reading; from 1st page to last page books have full of anxiety. I am very thankful.
Finally finished reading Amish Tripathi's trilogy. Some people of the 'intelligentsia' as well as of the 'orthodox' streams belittle it as pulp fiction. I found the books very well researched, an alternative view of how the hereos of a particular time evolve into Gods, an interesting look at ancient India, and its links with Pariha (as Persia was then called). What is most intriguing however is the conviction with which the writer re-writes mythology and presents it as an alternative reality bordering the realms of the outrageous, almost as unbelievable as the mythology is.
Read a book after long time. And I am impressed how one could present Mythology in such a beautiful manner
Amish has justified every myth regarding shiva..except there is no parvati....looking forward for Mahabharat
, Shiva continues his quest in recognizing and then deciding to eliminate the evil. Story line is a bit flat as there is next to no character development as almost whole main cast had already been introduced in Book 1 & 2. Book 2 carries the story further and Shiva discovers that evil may not always be evil in entirety. What is good for one can be evil for other. Also, one has to look at the broader picture to decide whether it is good or bad for society in general. Major part of the story is wasted in overtly details about the what is going inside Shivaâ€™s mind. Honestly, I skipped a couple of score of pages and did not miss anything; and that is saying something. One thing that has been used very well though is time compression. Normally, chapters do not jump over longer durations of time but this one did. Shiva and Sati, despite being the central characters are irritable and display inscrutable behavior. Cover comes in the form of Ganesha who then explains the situation to readers by means of asking questions to other characters. By then, however, the reader has been taken through the mind numbing action. It is no comparison to any other series that I have read so far. However, I had distinct feeling of nothingness when I finished other series like, Robert Langdon or Harry Potter which for some reason Shiva trilogy did not leave me with. I finished the series and am ok with it ending up.
This series is an epic series based on Indian mythology and this book gives an epic ending to this wonderful trilogy. ITS A MUST READ. The delivery was really fast,within around 2 days. Happy with this book and flipkart!
Is an awesome trilogy with the first two books being the better of the three. The last one is a bit of a drag and slower and your interest may wane. But a good read overall!
First two was great and excited.. but last part.. Author show Shiva week... n Sati much stronger.. not expected this end.. was expected much more...
I was surprised to see that the books were delivered the third day after placing the order. The seller is making sure the orders are shipped on time. The books are great too.
Awesome book and a perfect ending to the triology... Was expecting as though the series never ends...!!!
The series is compelling and you wont rest till you finished it. By the time I was through with the Shiva trilogy , it was as if they were people I met everyday and had a conversation with. Amish's description of the customs, life styles, codes and coduct of that era is truly captivating and thought provoking. His style in blending our mythology and history is extremely unique and keeps one fascinated as the story unfurls.
I have never been dissatisfied with the quality service of flipkart. The book is a treat to read. But would suggest to read the first two parts before reading the last. Will always look forward to shop with flipkart.
Amazing written and you'll fall in love with each character. Quite intriguing and will compel you to believe in just cause than perpetrating any religious views :) I loved the motto behind Har Har Mahadev , how it' captured in the book :)
First two editions are much better. The build-up to this was good but somehow this seems a hurried finish.
I gifted this book to my mother and as per her it is a good read, however the first two version were much better.
Though I am a regular buyer on Flipkart.com, but I have ordered books for the first time. However, I am not impressed with the quality of books (total 4 nos.). I have received from Flipkart.com. The quality of book is similar to the ones available on roadside (read pirated ones) or sold in the trains (read pirated ones) at 50 to 60/- rupees. I have bought many books from the book shops & I am aware about the quality. But, I am not impressed with this buy from Flipkart.com
Just a wonderful read. Diverted too much from Indian history but still managed to mark the point. The cover was nice so as the the characters in the book. Best u can expect from an Indian author.
A edge os the seat page turner !! Loved this and the earlier books- Immortals of Mehula and secrets of the Nagas. Worth every penny spent on the 3 books. Only one regret- finished reading it in a span of 5 days. :( Now hunting for a similar book.
After the first two books this seemed great asusual After the first two books this seemed great asusual After the first two books this seemed great asusual
great as its predecessors......... nice one read the whole series within a month , and it is being read by my friends (final year engg ) in a great way.
the end is great, the fight of sati will go down as a legend. but the book lacked the thrill of the immortals of meluha. sometimes i felt the scientific explanations to be very lengthy and boring. The end is dramatic and classic though..
Good and interesting way of narration, worth reading the book.. Amish is an extraordinary story teller, his way of narrating the story is exceptional. The three parts are divided with a true and clear logic and this ""The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3"" has justified the end and completed the Shiva Trilogy in a great and an unexpected way - Waiting for few more books from Amish in this category.. Thankyou Dear for putting your efforts to bring out such a masterpiece. The First & Third Part is fabulous.. overall series is filled with an excellent story, sometimes it feels like the scenes are running before our eyes.. :) All The Best Amish - Keep The Good Work Coming out of your Kitty Bag..Keep It Up.. We will be waiting for your next books..
amish has done a great job. it requires an outstanding skill to weave your imaginations to produce this masterpiece. i was reluctant to put down this last series, wanting more.
The book was a bit of a let down after the first two books in the trilogy. In trying to tie modern electronics with "ancient" knowledge, I think Amish took the metaphor to far ... The explanation of mind-reading was just too much to agree or grasp. The idea of what the Vayuputras were and what they would support was also weird. There weren't any genuine high points like book two ... which had gems like "Apathy is the opposite of hate". Overall tad disappointing
Its the third book in Meluha trilogy and its a great read. Of course reading the first 2 books from the trilogy before you attempt your hand on this will make it enjoy this even more. All and all must read.
First of all, one need to first read previous two books of Shiva Trilogy to understand this book. Character of Shiva enhances as the book advances and reaches to pinnacle quite a few times Shiva takes the decisions to justify the war or control the war. To a quite extent art of war is quite impressive. However, it ends with a massive blow to readers (as I started following Shiva and his ideology) when Shiva decides to use the WMD. This reminds me saying: "Given a situation human behaviour is same" and Shiva was no exception. He goes blind and blank at the end to take avenge and I would still believe it could have been handled much better. While reading keep looking at back side of first page to check river and cities location. Google will not help as event drawn in this book is from ancient India.
I wont say much about this book since everything that is to be said has been said. What I must tell you guys is that if you ever wanted to read books please let your first book be this book series. This is the 3rd and the last in the franchise get the other two and read them. You'd be transferred to a different world altogether. Keep reading!!
For the people who loves alternative history and thrillers this is the best ever combination I have ever read. So for the readers who loves reading I must say..."DONT EVEN THINK OF MISSING IT". But for the occasional readers, spend somewhere else. its not for you. You need to go really deep to understand the philosopy of this master-piece
It was a very interesting reading. Thank god that i bought all the 3 books together. Otherwise it would have been tough to wait for the next book after finishing the previous one. The detailed narration enhances the reading experience.
the depiction panache enthralls me through out the journey from devgiri to panchabati via branga and back to devgiri. the contemporary writer Amish portrays the ancient deities and their saga in an anthropically manner which indeed emanates a feeling of humanness..
Amish is a fabulous story teller. Just loved the entire Shiva Trilogy especially this book. Although some part of this books seems quite slow and more descriptive than usual eventful-flow. But overall this is simply a great book full of mystery, adventure and thrill.....must read :)
Book was good but would like to appreciate Flipcart for their excellent delivery. I am very very Happy with flipcart. Please keep it up. Thanks
This last book of the famous mythological trilogy has lived to its expectation. Its a page turner altogether which just binds you to its story line from the first line. The author's imagination to collaborate the mythological stories , concepts with the protagonist - Shiva's life is highly appreciated. Amish lived beyond my expectation. It should be converted into a feature film. Bravo Amish!
All the 3 books have been great. The ST - 1 was amazing and i cudnt wait to finish it at the earliest. The ST-2 was a little slow i felt but dint reduce the enthu to finish the book. The last book was awesome... but dint expect a sad and devastating ending.... Well written Amish ji.
The trilogy set was really cheap. HAPPY WITH THE DELIVERY AND THE QUALITY OF THE PAGES. hOPE TO GET MORE BOOKS WITH OFFERS
the shivatriology is an awsome series to all the readers interested in the historical fiction. Amish - the author of the book has well articulated scenes in the chapters and shown how he has imaged n thought of the god to be present at a time back in centuries to a normal human being. thumbs up to the author :)
Just loved the entire Shiva Trilogy especially this book. It is a fabulous reinterpretation of what could have been. Shiva is indeed the destroyer. There are some other top novel reads on Flipkart including "Indians in Pakistan," an awesome book on the changing of sides of terrorists in Pakistan. The book rocks and I would advise all of you to check it out. It has even changed my mindset entirely.
Excellent book by the Amish.. has done a great job... Have read his all three books... And excellent service by Flipkart.. This book was delivered on time..
The author managed well - good suspense, twists Drained of philosophy and packed with action and adventure.
Itâ€™s almost impossible, if you are writing a fiction, based on mythology and not letting it overlap each other, keeping the stories marvellously parallel; as with such an overlap one end up hurting the sentiments of readers. This series was so deadly close that FICTION and MYTHOLOGY could have overlapped any time, but both were like the railway tracks, never overlapping but complimenting each other. The borderline of mythology and fiction were perfectly kept inline. So close, yet so far. The line has never been breachedâ€¦ It shows the understanding, the research, the thoughts, the philosophy, Amishâ€™s feelings and devotions to Lord Shiva that the piece that must have been close to his heart is now similarly that close to oursâ€¦ Oom Namah Shivayâ€¦ May Lord Shiva bless us all....
Amish has done a wonderful job providing intricate details and pictureque description. Loved the way the story unfolded and was truly mesmerized by the story. Waiting for Amish's next endeavour.
If you like Dan Brown's books I would recommend you to try Amish's books , Such a wonderful manner of writing which combines myth and imagination . The narration manner made me to flip pages impatiently to know what comes next..
This book was good, but it lacked a sound ending. Had me gripped anyway.Not as good as the first two, but is still a good book. It would've been good if this came in hardcover because paperbacks tend to get worn very fast.
The first two books of these series are very interesting and highly gripping. This book has released with lot of expectations. Though it started on very high note, slowly you will lose interest after reaching half of the book. Bit disappointed on how it ended!!
Good book. If you start with meluha. Can cant hold back from reading this book. But still the last part is bit lengthy..
Written in great style. Lot of improvement as compared to the first part. However ending is a bit disappointing.
This book and the previous 2 sequel were the best book written by an Indian author..unlike Arvind Adiga etc...who simply go out n sell India's problems n limitations in the global arena.
Though the book was not as interesting as the first two books, the author has made a wonderful work and I loved it.
It might get quite boring in between but all is not well with the end... Try to read through couple of hundred pages and you will get that Secret of Nags feeling :)
Writing a review after almost a year after I purchased it since I started reading it recently. I remember the flipkart's delivery was prompt and it reached next day of official release since I pre-ordered it. Ah! Such a big book(565 pages) at the end of trilogy! So its expected to have slow un-necessary plots in between. The ending was not good according to me since one of the main character dies and town gets destroyed because of that. But that does not make it a bad book, as the whole reading experience was good with lots of psuedo-science, history and mythology discussions spanning across multiple countries. My actual rating would be: 3.25. But can't assign that value and 4-star is too much and so I rate it humble 3.
I don't know if it's just me - but I thought the quality of writing progressively reduced in each sequel. Okay-ish read by this one.
The content of the book is not great . Probably I had more expectation from the book . The ending of the book i.e I would say almost 30% of book is kind of boring and seems like being unnecessarily streched .
The book is interesting maintaining continuity from the earlier two books...but disappointing at the end. The end could certainly have been better. ...did not match with shiva's ideology maintained in the earlier books
Very interesting trilogy..... I have read all the three books..... Very engrossing and excellent material
Thrilling, tragic and heart-breaking are the three key-words that sum up my review even before it starts. The Oath of the Vayuputras is the Final book of The Shiva Triology written by a now improved writer Amish Tripathi. His writing style has been abysmally poor in the first two books, but he picks up the art by this book. Yet, his lack of ability to smooth out his story stays visible. He struggles to describe the events as they happen in a better format than what he'd used in the past pages. His introduction to characters is still blunt and the way they behave is easily predictable. The story, though, as always, is brilliant. There are twists and turns that one can't see coming, unless one is learned on these subjects. I loved the way Amish built up the story to reach the crescendo. And the way he achieved it! There are parts that will make you immensely sad, and parts that will break your heart and Amish provides no palliative care for the injuries, but I think he had no choice there. The story had to proceed the way it did. The book is perfumed with war, death and hope. And a lot of knowledge! In conclusion, I'll recommend this book for all the Indians who believe, or not in Lord Shiva for this is a fiction that will render a magical faith in your new favorite hero! I enjoyed reading this book, and I think everyone else will too!
awesome creation by Amish. Great combination of mythology & Imagination. Loved the part where foundations of society is explained. A Gripping trilogy. However they should have released the third book in hindi also.
the book is the third installment in the shiva trilogy series and hence holds a specific grip to the series, the book as its other parts is extraordinary and the narration of the incidents are yet lively...the book gets you on a ride of emotions, fierce battles, betrayal and love with lots of secrets to be revealed advised to read in continuation with previous parts to enjoy the emotional connection
It was all my greatness to read this book... It is a must in every home... I am sure people of all ages and generation will enjoy the story and also learn a lot of ethics, morals and discipline which can be used in the individual's everyday life. Must Read. Thanks to Amish Tripathi. He is the best.
Har Har Amish's Trilogy!!!! Har Har Amish's Trilogy!!!! Har Har Amish's Trilogy!!!! If you thought simplicity and smoothness would affect the impact and intensity of your writing, then you got 3 reasons to re-think. Har Har The Immortals of Meluha!!!! Har Har The Secret of the Nagas!!!! Har Har The Oath of the Vayuputras!!!!
old story...told in a different manner........grt entertainer.....jst lovd it....no match for amish tripathis story telling skills......my fav author.......looking forward for more books by him......
book was awesome..worth reading for those who are not proficient in english.. awesome work by flipkart in delivering the product.
Nice ending to the trilogy. fun readin the final part. delivered to me the next day of my order, good service from flipkart.
Recd d book,..however the page quality is not good,..seems like a fake copy,..could have bought a fake one by paying much less amount,....
Well this is the 3rd and the final version of the Shiva trilogy where he finds out the real evil that is harming India and also removes it out of the equation... Its a must read from me considering that i finished the book within 2 days of it being delivered to me..' But before you read this you have to read the 1st two parts..
Again this series is also full of thrillers and adventures.The twist given to the story is wonderful. If any one read the first series then he will definitely know about the facts and the continuation of the story.
After getting so many positive reviews,I bought it for gifting it to someone. Cannot say much about this book for now. Will update once I get the update from the reader.
Although the first one was the best, this book also kept me hooked. Really loved the way the story has been crafted.
I finished reading it a long time back.. got it as a combo offer.. really cheap and paperback.. but its really amazing!! Truly keeps the readers in their toes and some times the description of the event could do a bit better (no I am not putting the exact story parts) but overall it just bombards and expands my imagination manifold!!
I really enjoyed reading previous two books but somewhere I felt this book has been dragged to increase number of pages. But to be honest I really wanted to finish this book quickly because of previous two books.
Living with the strength of the plot, the emotional intelligence added to the subject with a great interpretation of the present generation has given this book a great sense of reality and uniqueness exploring the ancient cultural heritage of India . Har Har Mahadev.
I bought books second time from this site... and as expected i received delivery in 3 days and also all tracking emails, SMSs... Good chain.
SHIVA TRILOGY IS AN AWESOME BOOK..........WONDERFULLY RESEARCH.......LOVED IT.....STRONGLY RECOMMENDED IT FOR ALL TO READ
Got the book today. Excellent packaging and books printing and feeling looks good. Happy with the service.
History served in modern style..!! Will keep u fascinated..!!! Amish has described everything with logic which we all thinks magical.
mythology and bollywood masala , mixed up for a racy read... i have already finished my review, now just filling up 100 words...
If anyone has interest in history / mythology â€“ Shiva Trilogy is a great fiction. I am very impressed by Amish writing style.
They say Amish is Tolkein of the west.. Its damn true. The journey takes us to making of LORD Shiva from just Shiva. It is a very nice read indeed. And no one matches the delivery done by flipkart with so nice packing with bubble sheets and specially the bookmarks.. :-) thanks flipkart.
I have to worth buy. As even my parents enjoyed reading it. So am giving it 4 stars as it is not a must read but one enjoys reading it.
He dont kno anthing about Shiva..He has written simply lyk a superhero..Its a commercia book not related to god..
this book is a total disappointment.. worst book i have ever read.. i expected Shiva's character to be more strong.. expected book to be less draggy.. the book is long and boring.. a complete waste of time.. for those who have read the 1st 2 parts, just read the spoilers online and get the summary of this book.. do now waste ur time on the book..
The Oath of the Vayuputras, the last of the Shiva trilogy is all guns and glory. A book filled mostly with battle and the rest philosophy. In terms of story, it is a good book. Mortalizing the Mahadev and the other deities and taking the story forward is no mean feat. It started well with the first book, hooked us by the second (and the best) part and the third sounded very promising. In that context this was a bit of a let-down. Yes, there had to be a logical end to the story, vanquishing of all evils and a peaceful ending to war of Meluha. This book has it all, just not the way I had expected it to be.
Shiva Trilogy - Amazing Book. Always adds up to the collection. Am not going to reveal the deep thrills and exitement the author has packed in this trilogy but kudos to Amish Tripathy. The Battle between the good and the evil, an eternal love story, and faith is what this collection is all about, but what matters is how the author has described every minute details. I was waiting for the combo pack of the Shiva Trilogy. Flipkart gave me the deal which is far better than the market price. Not just that, they shipped it in two days and great packaging. Flipkart has again Wowed me.
one word will simply describe it...fascinating..the long wait after the first 2 books was worthy...really a classic end to the epic saga...full of emotions...yes, probably it contains more emotional segments than the other two...now, the eagerly waiting for this gem of a series to be converted to movie...
The book is jaw-dropppingly best. The end of a legend. But I say the end chapters are little bit boring and it suddenly ended with a Bang. Still its unputdownable like other books.
Different take on Mythology. It is complete with detailed accounts of places and Maps. Shiva- the Monk, the romantic, the warrior and the King. Loved every aspect!
clarification...flipkart was wonderful... its the novel thats disappointing.At times there is so much explanation that u feel u r sitting in a nursery class and the author loses track of the story line. Dear amish please trust the iq level of your readers to understand some basic things without your detailed explanations. the end is also alet down.
The Best Sci fi and Mythological Novel Ever by an Indian Author. Extraordinary merging of science with mythology. this will make u believe all that is written on the book is true that has happened in the past.
Redifines evil side of good. Though bit lengthy, nice way to depict details. Flipkart at it's best in service. 5 stars for book and flipkart.
This book in the trilogy is a fitting end to the Shiva family saga.. it is engrossing and I had to finish it in one go.. cannot put this one down before you reach the last page, and even then you want to read some more!
Never got to finish the book. Felt like a drag. It has been passed on to a friend from whom I would get the gist of it.
The trilogy was am amazing journey. this last book however isn't as full of surprises as the other two. it starts off slowly and the author spends a lot of time describing war preparations and formations. but there are some chilling moments of suffering and vengeance. if anything the climax is a true testimony to the humanness of Shiva's character.
This novel , the last of the Shiva Series , is very good read . Though at times you will feel that the story is stretched . But the story ended fantastically with a story and with a purpose .
the delivery was, as always timely. about the book: BORING is the word. what's happened to Amish Tripathi ? His 1st 2 books were phenomenal...why such atrocious behaviour towards the third and the final book? As the wise guys said " too many cooks spoil the broth" , Amish should have taken care of the no. of characters he brought in. The story fizzles off in between the book. So, the book's not exactly wha you'll call a page turner.
This book is just superb just like the previous 2 books of amish..yeah i felt it a big dragging towards the beginning but still its just a gret book to be read tat u cannot just stop reading :) waiting eagerly for amishs next book :)
While I began reading the book the moment I bought it, it took a while for me to get absorbed as I had forgotten most of the characters by the time the 3rd book hit the stands. The story moves very slowly over the first few chapters. Then suddenly the pace improved and I managed to complete the book. The first two books had built my expectations too much and I have to mention that I was a mite disappointed.
because of this book AMISH is my favourite writer book was amazing i was stick to this book i will not tell u the ending but it was very sad
The narration is good. It holds you to the book. It is quite a lengthy book, but it is worth completing.
I have been waiting for this book release and the book didn't disappoint me at all. Great thought which was never expected and I like the way of things falling in place.
Very few authors can keep up the interest and quality across 3 parts. The first two parts were pretty good and the third is ok-ok. Overall a good time pass read, if you have read the first two parts.
delivery of all three books was quick :) packing was too good, Awesome Books but Quality of paper is so so
THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I HAVE COMPLETED THIS BOOK IN THREE DAYS WITH MY BUSY SCHEDULE , AS SOON AS I STARTED READING THIS BOOK I WAS TOTALLY INVOLVED AND I USE TO IMAGINE , EVERY ONE SHOULD READ THIS
This is "THE BRILLIANT" book for 2013....loved it...i recommend this book to those readers who loves ancient / historic stories...with some spicy and movie style garnishing.
It really made me sad that after two awesome parts he third of the trilogy was not up to the expectation. But thanks to Flipkart that I got it a a Lower price on Pre-Booking and money was less wasted
This book is a dud if you compare it with the previous 2 installments. Very long and boring story. End is pathetic and makes you think why the writer wants to stretch a very good story when there is no story left.
Thrilling END to the awesome series, loved it totally. Could it have been better...?? I guess NO. A must read series for those who want to go through an epic journey. And a good thirst quencher for people who love reading Mythological Thrillers. GO for it if you are too...
As the title suggests all the three books are epic. The story takes on a beautiful journey of what is evil, and how did SHIVA became a god. Everything is nicely explained and there is no supernatural stuff. The trilogy is very immersive and a must read for all age groups.
It is a nice book, as good as two previous book Meluha and Nagas.... But little long...you have to be patience enough...ending was little Bollywood type....but this book has answer of all the question which you came across in two previous books...so dont miss it grab it right now and and read it... :) :)
first and Second books are excellent but this book hasn't reached the expectations. Characters always move around only one subject which is a bit boring. Those who purchased 1 and second can try the third one after the prices are slashed.
I recently read all 3 books in Shiva Trilogy. I have to accept that the author thought differently. I read books for fun without looking for much logic & this trilogy is total paisa vasool that way. First 2 books are fast paced page turners, Amish created a whole new world through his imagination. This world is not very different from what has been shown earlier in TV series like Chanakaya, Chandragupta etc, still Amish has crafted it really well & unique. There is novelty in every page & most of the characters are build up beautifully in these two books. When you arrive at third book, you initially feel bored. Amish has made a heavy weather of first 400 pages. There were too much descriptions. Too much here n there of war forces. It looked like author is not sure where he wants to take his reader. First 400 pages are merely time killers. It could have been well edited and 200 pages could easily be taken out of it. Having said that, You just can't miss the climax. Author is at his best in last 150 or so pages in this whole series. Author has shown some penchant for killings,gore n violence which could have been easily avoided. Trilogy could have earned 5 stars had author used some more tricks n politics rather than violence. I could never convince myself for 'Shiva'. His character looked like God more because author wanted to portray it that way than through his deeds. Anyways, I recommend this series wholeheartedly.
The Shiva triology is the most thrilling work of indian mythological fiction. The pace at which the story proceeds is really amazing. You can't miss even a bit of it. Once you start from part 1, you don't want to put down the entire triology. One would want to read it all 3 books in one go. The touch of indian mythology takes the series to different level. Name of characters, sanskrit words used through-out the series connects you to the stories you have heard in your child-hood. All in all, a must have in your personal library. P.S. Like all other times, Flipkart was at it's best to deliver this product in no-time.
All the three books are hilarious and Awesome. I'm sorry that I'm sending this review very late after I've finished reading the books, but I felt that it is neva too late. I was passionate about Lord Shiva since my childhood which drew me towards these books. But its like a DEEPDIVE for me in to an ocean to know more about Lord Shiva. Thank You Amish Tripathi for such wonderful research and information you've provided. Eagerly waiting for your next book.
i cant think i can deacribe the greatness of ghis book. i laughed, cried, was saddened in d last. but i was all along d book till d last page. jst brilliant.
I was always chasing Amish's blog to follow this trilogy. Completed reading it overnight. It is a more of a epic to me. Enjoyed every bit
It's keeps me busy all time.. good to have Trilogy in my book self.. It's keeps me busy all time.. good to have Trilogy in my book self.. It's keeps me busy all time.. good to have Trilogy in my book self.. Thanks, Shailendra Nagina
Firstly, about the delivery: Hats off to Flipkart for quick and safe delivery of the ordered material! And about the book: It's just superb. Amish has done an exceptionally brilliant job writing The Shiva Triology. The story is truly enigmatic. And what a befitting end to the triology!!
Every book lover should read this one. You cannot distinguish this between fiction, myth or puraanam. Must read.
Kudos to Amish ! I'm eagerly looking forward to read your next God given imagination:) You have proved that even the great god mans will have their own problem and how they overcome that. I salute you !
When I read the first part,i felt it was a new attempt, but the literature was kind of mediocre. I got the second part to see if anything had improved, But it seemed worse. I got the third book just to know how the story was made to end. But looks like the author just wanted to end the book. "don't judge a book by its cover" they say. In this case the story is not as good as the cover art. (would not buy another book by this author)
Much awaited book - was a nice read over all - A ll too many characters all working together and alone- but its Indian mythology afterall. Jus c'dn't accept the ending - wished badly for the story to end in a different way.
All three books are simply superb. Its very good and addictive. It makes you complete the entire book and do the next work. The shipping was really fast and the packing was great. I ordered all 3 books in a combo and saved money too. I would recommend everyone to go with combo offers if you still see at the time of your buying.
The final part also just does not let you keep the book down. Great book. I greatly admire the analogy between our mythology and the storyline.
The virtual life story of Lord Shiva is very Every scene brilliantly written. Won't talk much about the story as it may reveal the secrets. But yes, you will surely love the final part if you enjoyed the first 2 parts. I didn't expected the end to be the way it was, but it is justifiable. Too much detailed description sometimes make you feel to skip it and directly jump to the action part. The secrets revealed hold some logic and are not introduced just for the sake of making it a thriller. well imagined, expressed in a very nice manner.
Excellent book. The whole series was extra ordinary. The way of description, the follow-up, creation of suspense and its maintenance.. A total package..
{this was not as interesting as first two sequels... after the secret has relived... noting much was interesting... read the 1st two sequel in 7 days... this I have taken already 10 days only half completed...} I take back my above review... the end was not what I expected... this is finest book in this trilogy... Suggestion to autor: could have given map of travel inbetween to understand much better... Flipkart packing and delivery was excellent
I have read the other two books and my expectations were high for this book. I am disappointed after reading this book.
The structure and binding of the book is good. Although it is named as The Oath Of vayuputras you'll not find much about the Vayuputras in the book , except for a chapter or two. On an overall basis basis the book is a must for people interested in shiva fiction. I feel that the 2nd part i.e. The secret of nagas is the best one in all the three......................
Very disappointing fare by Amish. Not upto the mark. I pre-ordered this book however I am yet to finish this. Given that I usually finish a book within a week or two, this one could not keep me hooked and I lost interest midway.
not at all recommended. Amish is a ok writer but the book is dragged too much. The most horrible book which i've read so far
Humanity in Godliness. The books make for an excellent read. For those readers who are also aware of the Mythology, it is quite enjoyable to associate the characters in the novels to the roles played by their Mythological counterparts. All in all, an excellent set of books. I definitely am looking forward to his other works.
This was the third book and I was anxiously waiting for this one. It was a long wait almost a year. The book is hard to skip if you read the first 2 books,but its not upto the mark. The story is good but the climax could have been better. The book has action,drama, emotion and end to the saga. I like the authors writing style,he has certainly got young generation to read mythological books. I liked the book but not as the first 2 books.I am sure many would have an unavoidable urge to read this one,but keep your expectation low...:) Flipkart as usual does a good job ...Keep it up !!!
I was waiting for this book like anything after reading first two part but it didn't turn up to the expectations. Sorry if you don't like my comments but I expect very much more than this from Amish.. I think he wrote this book in really in hurry and under pressure of to finish this saga. If I take out my expectation from here, it is still worth to read.
Book is awesome.And flipkart is a reliable place to buy it.What else do you need.Delivered the book on time...What else.... There is no need to right 100 word review for this
Had High Hopes For this book.. but it ends suddenly n without much of a mistery.. But u have to read just to complete the story...
very interesting novel the author has glued the book on the readers hand. I was not able to stop reading till the end.
First of all excellent service by Flipkart. I have become a fan of flipkart's service. They deliver products so quickly with best pakaging. I have finished the 1st book only "Immortals of Meluha". Its an awesome book. Mythology in this form is so unexpected and pleasantly surprising. With every page I finished, i was waiting to go to the next book. Hoping to finish the other books asap. Great work Amish Tripathi.
It is a shade behind its prequels, but if you have read them, then you cant stay away from this. Although a little tedious and the end being a sort of anti climax, you may find it a decent read...
I am pleased at the excellent tribute to Loard Shiva. I should have been happy if the Shiva forgave Daksha and desist from using Pashupathy asthra. It Would have been more magnanimous! Enjoyable!
Not so gripping as its predecessors but OK for light reading............ the author could have done a better job.
Disappointed with the content of the book. The first book had good philosophical ending. 2nd book had lot of good twists. This does not have either and ending seems very much abrupt.
i had pre ordered this one and received it the day it was launched.. such a speedy delivery..in love with flipkart for that.the book obviously is a good read. amish has done a splendid job in this part of the series..
har har mahadev!!! hats off to d author i recommend dis book tto evry1 easy to understand and very interesting
The worst part of this book is that there is just too much description of wars.. I mean how the wars will be executed.. etc.. It just drags on after a while. Even though i wanted to know what happened to Shiva in the end.. i could not complete this book.. This is really that much boring. The author could have skipped the war stuff.. i mean.. it's really so annoying..
These books are full of crap. Amish has not done his homework properly. He has gotten even the basic mythological facts wrong. It is just a figment of his imagination, and not a good one. He has altered the facts according to his comfort. There are way better books in the marketplace to read than this. A total waste of money I would rather set my money on fire.
Spoilers Alert: I was hoping that Vayuputras will have better role in the story. Tried to go in deeper meaning of life and philosophical stuff, nice try, but not great. Disappointed when compare this to the first two books in the series. Read it if you have read the first two. Buy it if you have bought the first two-just to complete the collection.
Engaging illustration, gripping narration style, is unique, which hold you on to the story. Recommended reading, since its an action filled comic, anyone of any age can pick it up.
U need to buy this book to complete the Trilogy but I must say it is not as good and as breathtaking as previous two books...
Found this book to be slow and dragging without any substance to offer unlike the first two books of the trilogy which still managed to pique my interest. a couple of friends who have like me followed the trilogy, managed to read this book and have advised strongly against completing it, stating that its nothing but a disappointment.
Nice conclusion of the trilogy. I had picked up the first book as a casual read but by the time I completed it, i was too eager to get the next one..and the next one.. What I loved about the book was the contemporary take on the life of a God. Loved the logical explanations of the 'neel-kanth' , the sati-incident, Goddess Kali and Lord Ganesh and the story behind their physical resemblance.. Couldn't really ask for more.. 5 stars for Amish and 5 stars for Flipkart for the nice delivery
horrible ending , amish even advertised his next book in this one , neva gonna read his books again ... after his first 2 books i was expecting the same and a kickarse ending and the way lord shiva gets his third eye , i dont have words ..pathetic , 5 stars to d first 2 books , and i am giving 2 stars jus because the previous books were good
A very good read.... The author has managed to keep his readers mesmerized right from the beginning. Must read
Conclusion always draw split opinions and a rage of war between satisfied and dissatisfied. I think Amish have done a commendable job and one should take it as a good read and inspiring one too. I kept on drooling for about a month and even went on searching web for maps and other name and places detailed in the novel. Its that close to reality. My words... Recommended. Because... Inspiring, Detailed, Beautiful, Soulful.
Perhaps Amish set himself high standards with his previous books! Perhaps we, the readers, increased the benchmark outta high expectations! Perhaps this book could have been really good had it not been a sequel! Perhaps.. . . I couldn't actually bring to believe that the third and final sequel would be such a let down. (At least that is what I felt personally)!
The narration and characters are excellent. The ending is little bit disappointment. The first two part have nice interest, which is reduced on third party. Certain characters could have more jsutification.
The First part was interesting, but the 2nd and third part lose all the perspective and meander around like a Hindi Cinema Plot
This story, not only this one but all the creations of Mr.Tripathi is very innovative. A gud story for people of every age to read. It also increases english language vocabulary. Everyone according to me should read this Shiva Trilogy by Amish Tripathi. - Oytijhyo Banerjee
1st two parts were good... but this book..the climax sucked... not what lord shiva would have done...stupid thinking i really liked the concept of the movie but the big let down by the author in the finale not a great ending but a good trilogy....
This is another gem in a journey of Amish! The best thing is that as you go on reading the story, it, sometimes, feels as if the characters from the book are playing infront of your eyes. Such is the fluency and articulation of his masterpiece writing!
i felt good after reading these books. it explains lots of super natural concepts in a realistic way. lots of scientific thoughts made it a believable story though its a story.. The concept somras is actually a kind of antioxidant is really a good or best concept ever.. Excellent thriller no doubt.
Book Ending is not all that great. But pre-ordered on Flipkart and arrived on time before the rest of India had a chance to look at the book. Flipkart, the best as usual.
After reading the first two books i was eagerly waiting for this to come and was utterly disappointed with this book. worst of the three and times it felt like the story was uselessly getting dragged
The Shiva Trilogy's first and second edition is one of the finest books in fiction category, i have ever read. But, third one is little down when compared to first two. But, a big thumbs up for this series.
The book has many twists and has a very impressive narrative style.Damn good.
This does not stand upto the reputation of the first 2 books. But I think it is common with all the series of book .. that the last book is below expectations .. Please read the first 2 books before venturing onto this book.
this book is a complete let down if u compare it with previous 2 books... was hoping for a better climax... more descriptive n hence gets lil boring...
First : Written in modern english. So, it takes away little interest off reading. Written in plain english language make it child novel rather than for grown up fantasy lovers like me. Second: Story could have improved. I don't like the abrupt ending. Shiva went to vayuputras place and there he didn''t do anything special. I was hoping to see Shiva's real hidden power released with the aid of Vayuputras. Instead, he bring one missile to blast Pavtri's father town. :-/ Third: reason behind often aich in the middle of eyebrows was what?? bogus.... I hate this part most. anyway, i did like the start but not the ending. So, 3 stars i struck right away
If you have read the 2 parts, you'll of course want to read this. It's a bit drag in the middle but anyhow it's a good one.
Just like GP Sippy cant make sholay everytime, one my of my favourite author as well. Though the magic which shown in first two of trilogy was missing, it is must read if you had read first two ,mainly to complete the trilogy and sheer respect first two volume created...
THE OATH OF THE VAYAPUTRAS has not lived up to the standards of AMISH TRIPATHI'S previous two books. It gets really slow in the middle..... I just bought this one to complete the shiva trilogy........but amish tripathi has failed to deliver.....!! Dont expect the same standard that you found in the previous two books.....!!
The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3 , is one of the best books one could ever have in their collection. I would recommend this to everyone. No second thoughts about it. This is not my first book from flipkart. I am happy with their services.
Wow... This Trilogy is worth buying for some 1000 Bucks too.. There were some parts where i went completely emotional.. The last one "Vayuputras" has some real touching scenes.. Amish Tripathi takes it to extreme HEIGHTS... The way he Narrates.. the way he gives the complete plot of the story.. every single thing he delivered is awesome... People won't be able to experience this kind of stuff every now and then. Order it now... u wont Regret..
I loved the previous two books. I thought this one was too long, most of the times I felt like skipping the pages and I did not like what happened in the end. :(
I would say its an epic end to an epic trilogy...Amish has managed to turn a mythology into something that can be easily accepted to have really occurred in ancient India.Truly amazing.
Nothing bad but i started loosing interest twowards the end. Maybe because it was too long (3 books). Had to stretch my imagination too hard to understand the content.
Ordered this book on 28th oct and received it on the next day Gr8 service by you guys Well about the book One of the most best books I have read I ordered this will the other 2 books i.e The Immortals of Mehluha & The Secrets of the Nagas Awesome collection A must buy book for every Indian
Disappointing end to the trilogy. Doesn't thrill as much as the first two. Flipkart service is as usual the best. But Author Amish has lost it all.
Though not as good as the first or the second part but even then its very much worth reading........ !!!
Not as good as other two books... but if you start to read the trilogy... you have to read this book.....
The last in the series of Shiva Trilogy 3, Vayuputras series the action is slow paced not as better as the first two !
I am a reader who expects Happy ending. I was truly surprised by the way the trilogy ended. I am truly impressed by the way the author established and maintained characters in the story. However, I'm deeply disappointed by the way things ended, especially the last chapter is so gloomy. I would recommend readers to stop reading the book at the 'Final Kill' chapter, if you like Happy endings !!
No words are required. The author has done it exceptionally great to end the story of lord shiva. the way the story has started from the Manasasarovar and the flow in which we can find a suspense on each and every page and it is reviled at the end of the next page for every question that comes in mind while reading the previous page and finally the way it has ended. We expect more of this kind of stories from the author.
The success of "Immortals of Meluha" certainly is responsible for the trilogy of Shiva and Amish might not have had plans to make this into a trilogy... If the first part was a peak of this trilogy, this third part is a blight...
Flipkart rocks for its delivery before time. The story's ending goes as per the mythology but end of Sita was painful, I am sure people would cry reading the last part of the book.
It is a best among History and fictional navels. Like Kalki krishnamurthy and Dawn Brown, Amish also did his wonderful job. I am eagerly waiting for the next book series.
The thrilling expierince of shiva as a human, through this 3 parts i can now imagine the myth character into reality, who has feelings , fight, thrilling experience. really nice try by amish
A good read. Though little dragged, the 3rd book has good twists and turns. You can see shiva as a super hero.
I have read all the three parts of this trilogy and all the books are amazing. I even recommended my friends also to read it and they also felt the same.
The author is totally illiterate about Hindu Dharma, Mind full of venom & dirty. Good comic for Christan/Muslims society.
I read the first two and liked them. Not exactly classic literature but a good entertaining read. This third book somehow is lacking what the first two had and I have not been able to finish it. Have to give it another go. Overall the series is a decent entertainer and a nice twist on Shiva's story. I wish he had fleshed out the other characters a LOT more. They have so much potential and there could be so many sub-plots which would, if carefully done, really enrich the story. I'll update this review once I finish the book :-)
This is a grand finale. But try To Purchase it in hindi to feel the feelings of writer. suspense of this book never ends anywhere. at Each and every position thinking of writer is more ahead than that of the reader. Parsuram Appearance in this book create a wonderful adventure in this book.
immortals of meluha and secret of nagas had many good twists and turns ......where as vayuputras seemed little boring. Yet !!!!!! the entire boredom flies away in the end. The description was sooooooooo awesome and I must say I cried a lot. :P Worth reading. A very good approach by Amish :)
As I bought this cause it was a sequel of Nagas , so I had many expectations and it didn't last for long as this book is not written in such a compassion as earlier ones most of the part in the book seems like irrelevant while reading and made half of the book boring.
This is way too under prepared and lack the thrill which the 1st two books had. It seems this has been written in a hurry, author really disappointed with this book.
shiva trilogy is a magnum opus of Amish`s writings, amish`s portrayal of shiva is amazing. love, drama, and action packed in it.
its last in its trilogy and finish with a boom...i like this book so much. as i bought all three in one go and i could not resist finishing it. the virtual story of god of gods makes you believe that shiva may be sitting somewhere in mansarover. waiting for a movie...!!!
fitting end to the trilogy, somehow the dramatization in the first 2 parts sees missing. But with the story more or less close to the original, there is not much scope of dramatization.
Awesome but not as good as the previous two books by Amish, i.e "The immortals of Meluha" and "The Secret of Nagas"
initially concept of relating charater and sequences to so reasoning was some what logical in first two episodes. but third episode authother seems to forgot the write by heart and written in view " how can i make it more crazier and insane and earn money" not worthy of read, even i could not ...
Last episode of the Shiva series, The Oath of Vayuputhras : was a disappointment. Blunders continued to appear here and there, not enough thought was given by author before and after writing this episode I believe. May be, the publishers were pushing the author to complete the book before the tide changes! The biggest book of three, I felt difficult to stay awake through the middle portions of the episode. So, the series as a whole : It was an excellent start, Okay middle portion, and Disastrous ending!. If the book was 50 to 80 pages lesser than it is now, It may have been a good one. Anyways, It was a good series, enjoyed reading it.
The third book in the series by amish didnt dissappoint at all as it was a well written final book of the series...will keep you at the edge throughout...
It feels like he stretched the story to end it. The first one was great book and even the second was better. But this one happened to be a time wasting effort. I didn't expect this to be like it.
best book of shiva triology...adventure, thrill on evry page....n olso make u a bit senti at some stage....
I think the first was best, but this is great too. Narration is good, but the story had such great potential. Could've been better.
Kudos the flipcart delivery system. Review: It didnt live upto the expectations created by the first book. Slow start, stretchy middle and non eventful end. Finished this book just for the sake of finishing it. Amish needs to do lot of improvement to live up to the expectations created by his first book.
The end to a extremely well written saga was satisfyingly good. Amish has shown great promise and as a avid fan of mythology, would love to see his next writings. Though entertaining the end could have been a bit more elaborate. All in all a worthwhile read.
The triology has been ended in a way to coincide with the original legends.But do not go into arguing about the terms that hint to more modern scientific events, like the fission and fusion bombs.
after a long time any indian writer has given novel that attract the people and if you can easily walkttrough .. will certainly challenge your some older thought
Lengthier than other books of trilogy, but deserves that. A very good climax. I bet you will feel a sense of fulfillment after reading the book and it will haunt you for rest of your life. Though there are some additional details given but you can enjoy reading on the surface. I read it some 4-5 months ago but still remembering it makes me feel enthusiastic. enjoy reading it.
good read... a fitting end to the trilogy............. nice perspective on history..... Mr. Amish is a great writer and I hope to read many more from him...
Great plot and superb narration by Amish. All the pieces of all the puzzles generated in the previous two books of the series fitted well and culminated into a perfect ending. Flipkart's rating is Excellent, in terms of packaging and delivery!
This book is the fitting end to the trilogy. That said, personally, an anticlimax to the fast paced first book. That is how you can sum the entire series. That said, the book as a standalone was quite and interesting read. Writing this review makes want to read the entire series all over again.
Though not the best of the trilogy, having it through flipkart lets you heave a sigh of relief that you could complete the trilogy without having to spend too much. The details in the first / second in the series were fascinating, in this it becomes an unwanted distraction. The author seems to relate anything and everything that goes on around the world to tell Shiva's story
I preordered this book and got it just in the time that was committed. As I have already read the first two parts and was excited to receive it and read it in one sitting. The book is worth every dime. and I definitely recommend flipcart for preorders
Firstly, the book's too long. And it has no more twists and surprises left in it. Amish has successfully reduced a fantastic series into a typical bollywood-tailored novel. The only creative piece was the epilogue where he tries to tie it all up with the present world.
Well good enough, but had to skip a number of parts, for it being too lengthy. The end could have been better, but then it was a bold move to potray shiva as finally a human, with flaws.
The Last book in the trilogy is as good as the other two but the ending was not so exciting.... Flipkart Service is best ...........................................................
I was very exited to read this third book after reading the first 2 book which are hyped greatly. But the book is very boring and author is simply dragging the story. My other opinion is, Author calling the Lord Ganesh and Kali as deformed bodies. I wonder why no one has questioned Amish so far. We see a strong protest in other religions if someone writes like this. The same thing happened for one of Kannada book where a author has written content against individual's beliefs which hurts the devotee of Lord Ganesh. Now that book has got a stay order in karnataka High court. I suggest no to read this kind of book who are simply hyping this book. We being public should NOT encourage the authors by purchasing this kind of books.
I have admired Amish's approach of the story. The way he blends mythology and fiction deserves a standing ovation. Though the second book wasn't as impressive as the first one, the third installment has compensated for that! The unexpected climax and the messages he convey through the story are something that will make this book worth remembering. I hope he writes more on mythology. Har Har Mahadev!!
The book is a good read in itself and is difficult to put down, however it fades in comparison to the second book of the series 'The secret of the nagas' which was exceptional and full of many twists and turns but there are some extremely good events in the story which makes it worth the time and effort. The start was good, the journey was fun, the end could have been better.
The book is beyond explanation. After reading the first two parts I was quite confused how Amish is going to finish this master piece. But finally he fiinshed it. The combination of history, legends, the symbols, the Vayuputras, Basudevs, Faravshi, Lama and the fact getting converted to Myth. Everything goes smooth and make one more humble towards the past of this ancient land.
The book is a classic and should be read by all. Very simple way to teach the greatness of our history. Liked by all in the family. Great book!
All the 3 books of this trilogy have the power of converting an atheist into a believer. Amish Tripathi is one of the emerging and shining writers escalating towards perfection. Actually i ordered the combo "The Shiva Trilogy". Amish is an MBA from IIM-C. I mentioned this because in all the 3 books, you can feel the perfection and essence of his imagination and storytelling. The Oath of Vayuputras contains all the secrets of the first two books. The book from start to the end is gripping as compared to the first two books. But there comes a disappointment when Sati dies. I was indeed sad for almost a week. It would be no surprise if we compare Amish to Jeffry archer.
It is the third book of shiva triology series and it is as interesting as all these are.. although a litle disappointing turn is there in the end but it keeps its reader spell bound and as usual the service of flipkart is best this book cost 350/- but its here for 177/- only
Amish Tripathy has a winner once again. The way he has conceived the entire story and the plot of what we know from our mythology and converted it into a fabulously believable idea is something that one can only read to believe. The very fact that such an idea can be converted into a story and one which would be full of thrill,mystery,intrigue and all emotions that we human can think of,is truly a magnificent effort in itself. What we find here in this book is a culmination of that soldier's journey to destroy the real evil and how he tackles the various forces of opposition in his path and what sacrifices he has to make. Brilliantly written, especially the characterization and the narrations are so wonderful that one cant help but appreciate the minute detailings.His journey along the landscape of India are so vivid that one actually feels as if he is seeing the events,not reading them. A must read book, this one and the two before.And thank god that i knew that this was the last book of the trilogy. Couldnt have waited for so much more long to get the next issue as i had eagerly been for this one. Thanks Amish once again.Hope you would keep enchanting us more.
I just wanted to finish reading this Trilogy. I was about to buy this book from a local bookstore for 350/- INR but I was lucky enough to have come across this product on flipkart.com just spend 210/- and the package gets delivered at your door, thats worth it. As for the book, hats off to AMISH.... A good end to the trilogy....!!
Not as exciting as the part 1 and 2. Did not live upto my expectations. The build up part was good. But the battle part , sati's death and the 'nuclear' astra left much to be desired. expected the plot to hatch in a much better way.
Amish Tripathi has portrait Shiva as I always wanted to see. Shiva is no god here. He is a man who eventually becomes a legend and a God by his noble deeds. He does not possess any supernatural powers but a seamless, stern and magnanimous ability to decide changes the fate of the Nation: India.
A breezy read.... don't expect a literary masterpiece... the book is a bit long considering the first 2 books, but the author stays true to his style of delving into myths for the sake of the story and combining it with dodgy historical facts... which makes it enjoyable for conspiracy theorists :-) recommended to read the first 2 books to understand the storyline...
After loving d first two books I was very excited about d third and d final book of d trilogy.I was very sure that i am gnna love this book as much as i loved d first two and I almost hate to say that yes this fat book literally had some extra fat!!But apart from that Amish have really excelled in d war scenes..It is so detailed that u can visualise evry tiny movement..I am not too sure about d ending too.But d way Amish have projected Shiva as an human maybe thats what he wanted to justify nd keep it more real.All an all a good book.Yes I would recommend this book very much.
I have been a great fan of the Meluha series but saying truely the climax was not as expected........comparing it from Meluha & Nagas this novel donot have the good or better to say amazing or suprising climax...leaving the climax part it was awsum & nycly written strongly recomended not for starters.....
Terrible! After the other two books, this was a terrible one. The plot is good, the climax is awesome I agree but the type of writing is just horrible! This isn't expected from a great writer. I expected more from Amish. I read this books thrice and then realised that there was no proper connection between the chapters. The flow was being broken every time! But, on a positive note, the plot is amusing, bit melodramatic but touching the heart!!!
definitely amish gave such an awesome ending to the series.. as u flip through the pages ..the flow n d buk keeps u moving forward with excited eyes..eagerly waiting for the climax..n the anticlimax element of the buk..just makes ur mind turn upside down for a minute..a perfect finishing!!! though a sad one!!!
The Oath of the Vayuputras is an excellent experience of reading. After finishing the book I felt an empty space surrounding me. Even after two days I am not able to start any other book. I can think only about Siva, Sati and their family members, and other possible consequence of the story. Finally it is a must read book.
I ordered The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3. The book delivered on time within 3 days and in good condition.Keep going flipkart. Hope u continue with the same spirit so that u may generate further trust on your customers.
The story of Shiva started with big promises and ended up in disappointment, converting Shiva into a villain rather than a hero. The book begins with sermons on what is evil and what is good and how good turns into evil and that Shiva is born to destroy evil, etc.etc. There are so many war strategies discussed in the book, with vivid descriptions of gory and violent battles. It all builds up the expectation of a great end but surprisingly the book ends up in a thud, as if the writer was in a hurry to finish the book. As a result, the reader feels cheated in the end. In the end the great Shiva turns out to be a puny villain, with frailties of human-beings instead of any greatness. He destroys a whole city with its mortals, simply because some wicked fellows of the city killed his beloved wife, Sati, by conspiracy. Now what was the fault of the city dwellers who loved their city and chose to remain in it? He should have ideally killed the king and other perpetrators of the crime and destroyed the Somras factory, what was the need to obliterate the whole city by the use of nuclear weapon, that too when he had promised the Vayuputras that he would never use the weapon. What is most surprising is that he is least bothered about the assassins of his wife and about Bhrigu, the main trouble-maker. Rather he is simply hell-bent on destroying the Devagiri, like a mad man. What kind of greatness is this? Perhaps the writer has tried to link the ending of the book with the mythological story wherein Sati died by jumping into fire in her father Daksha's yajna and Shiva out of anger destroyed everything. But this is totally a different story, it could have been given a better treatment. Amish will have to work really hard to grow up as a great writer.
I was really looking forward to the end of the Shiva trilogy and i must say it perfectly fits in .... Hats off to Amish Tripathi who crafted this amazing book... If u are new here ,.. I highly recommend that you read Mehula first then Nagas and then u grab this book... BUT I HAVE TO SAY HONESTLY - THE SERVICES OF FLIPKART WAS NOT AS STATED ABOVE OR BELOW !! i WAS SUPPOSED TO GET IT ON 24 ... THEY PROVIDED IT TO ME ON 27TH !! AND THE FIVE STARS ARE FOR THE BOOK !!! NOT FOR FLIPKART :P
though the expectations where high due to the first two books.this book though it was good and a page turner but the ending was rushed.these are completely my opinion.but still a good book to read. Must read once
The concluding part of the Shiva Trilogy is the unwinding of the suspense built over the first Two Books. However, the Book lacks the charm of The Immortals of Meluha or The Secret of the Nagas, partly because of the fact, that here the author actually solves the mystery he had developed over Part 1 & 2, and also due to the readers' heightened expectation from Mr. Tripathi for an equally tight & well-knit storyline. Nevertheless, the book is a great read. The entire Shiva Trilogy is mine of philosophy, that focuses on the enjoyment of life as a colourful journey rather than a destination.
The Shiva Trilogy by Amish for me will always represent that whiff of freshness that stormed the Indian literary scene that was nearly choking with louveeee in 2010! (not that the scene is any different now [after 3 years] but the winds are definitely changing). The mythological â€“ historical â€“ adventure â€“ fiction series is all but immortalized as one of the trend changers amongst Indian books and Indian publishing as a whole. The series is creative, out-of-the-box and very much Indian. That exactly could be the reason why Amish is the latest rockstar of Indian writing in English.
Personally, I found the pace of the book to be ok. Many people found the end to be a bit disappointing but I think it was a decent end to a good story. If you haven't read this book yet, do read it. The packaging by Flipkart was decent. Received the book in 2-3 days of placing the order. P.S.: Flipkart, I really love those bookmarks you send with each book I order. Thanks! :)
The theme of the book was suddenly carried away to war...... From the very first chapter you will get to know only that a war ia coming..... No doubt the story is brilliant but my 5 stars are for Shiva Trilogy and not vayuputras alone......
The third and the final part of the shiva trilogy was an almost worthy successor, to the plot formed by it's predecessors until the end. Disappointed that it ended in a flash. Karthik, Sati and Ganesha are the ones who impress along with Vasudev chief Gopal though Shiva and the rest are bit shadowed. A great plot ends quite disappointingly.
The first two books always kept you on your toes but this last on disappoints in a way that the ending is like a Bollywood flick that just refuses to end. Except for the ending, the book like the entire trilogy is gripping and you feel a sense of loss after completing as its the end of a magnificent journey.
worth reading usually iam not sensitive and i cry rarely but when i was reading the climax i almost cried from my heart the author have picturised each and every shot in the book in front of our eyes it has a SATISFIED ENDING
ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AND END... BUT IT IS NOT SUPPOSE TO END IN A DISMAY!!......... I VERY GOOD SERIES CAME TO A VERY ABRUPT AND DISAPPOINTING END!!! COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BETTER ................................................................................................................................................................................................................
when i started reading this book, Lord Neelkanth was a superhero ....about 550 pages after, he ended up being a common hot tempered guy who has not only failed to go as per his strategy but has killed some thousands of innocent courageous melhuans......at the end it seemed that shiva lost his track of destroying the evil and his motto was to take "avenge" against daksha empire and that too for the loss of his beloved Sati.....well, a common man may behave in such a manner but the writer was portraying shiva as a man of intense morality....where did all his moralities escape at the time of crisis?the author just wanted to finish this trilogy and ended up saying that the present indians are the remnants of the foolish people who were not the residents of those ancient cities which have been destroyed by throwing a H-bomb(pashupatiastra) !!! and personally i dont believe that it was the somras which turned evil.... it was the rigidity the ego and the greed of the empire which was evil.......so at the end of the book i should say, shiva never found what the real evil was .........thanks to author
Only thing comes to my mind or only thing that has left an irreplaceable image on me when I think of shiva triology is the love, passion between shiva & his sati. Third installment of this series "Oath of the Vayuputras" shows it time and again that love between shiva & sati is magical, divine. Based on fiction with some mythological background Shiva triology has been one of the most satisfying readings for me personally. Even though at times (in the third book) I felt that it is being elaborated in some parts which was not necessary, it is acceptable because in the end our mind directs towards something which is divine, powerful, satisfying & a perfect ending. Though I must say that the chapter 45 (third book of this series) was tremendously engrossed me & brought lot of emotions within me, it is arguably the best part of this whole series. I wish most of our girls follow this lady called Sati. She is a perfect example for a women. Though I finished the book with a heavy heart, I must say it was totally fascinating experience & a fantastic journey. Individually I learnt a lot from these 3 books which I will try to follow in my life which will lead me close to divine. As said at the start, once you finish reading the book u will feel, passion, love, anxiety, fear, defiance, pain, sacrifice, ultimately end of evil. It should be a must read for everyone which revokes your thinking process. "HAR HAR MAHADEV"
book kinda falls flat after the build up of the first 2, but if you've read them then you'll want to finish the trilogy. and since flipkart wants me to have 200 charecters i will type some garbage. alkakajalkja
This book was anticipated as the 2nd one ended on good note. Unfortunately for me personally this looked little rushed, trying really hard to put "uber interpretation and way too much of geo separated areas interaction". It suffered in terminology (kilometer for example is used and at times - very contextual greeting is used). The pace too slackened in between. (This comparison is with last 2 books). Good part was portrayal of Sati as fighter for the right causes than the usual interpretation. All in all good effort to close.
If you are an engineering student like me and dont know how to extra elaborate your answers to fetch more marks then your problem ends here...!...! In short an elongated let down to its predecessors .
This book is faboulous...its really a good pick to read.......The series of books by amish are very nice.....i am very addicted to this series.....i have read all the 3 books just in a month of time. Atleast try the last book . Though the book has 600 pages it is really interesting once you take it in the hand you will not like to keep it without keeping down.
the book kept the interest to the last page. Amish sure know to keep the pace and the grandeur. For those who love the action would certainly love the battle of Bal-Atibal kund. With very little knowledge of Shiva "stories". i found this trilogy drawing me to know more about Shiva. I particularly didnt like the language format that is aimed at the youth, somehow could digest it along the period the story it is running.
When I picked up the first book of the Shiva trilogy - The Immortals of Meluha - 3 years back, I could not keep the book down until I finished it. Cut to 2013 - the much awaited third book - The Oath of the Vayuputras - I had to struggle to complete the book. The Immortals of Meluha was awesome! The secret of the Nagas was Good and The oath of the Vayuputras was a drag. Period.That pretty much sums up my take on the Shiva Trilogy. It's quite obvious that Amish the IIM grad took over from Amish the writer as the franchise progressed. The third book has no justification to stretch itself to almost 600 pages. agonizingly slow, painfully descriptive, and all that for what? for an end ( don't worry no spoilers here) that was absolutely disappointing. I am surprised however, to see so many good reviews for the book considering almost everyone I know in real life who had read the book shared a similar perspective. if you have read the first two books, you do not have too much of a choice but to read through the third one for closure. If not, read the first book and stop at that. P.S: If you're going to buy this book or any book for that matter, buy it here. Don't know about their entire portfolio but Flipkart's truly the best place for books!
Amish once again Proved with his narrative style, At some stage i felt my Eyes Moist. It took only a week for me to complete this Book such is the Story every Page. worth buying it..... Har Har Mahadev.....
A good read but a bit of a let-down in terms of the build up in the first two books. The ending was a bit of an anticlimax. Some characters and events could be better fleshed out. Flipkart delivery was quick and the product was delivered packed well and securely.
This is definitely not a great ending too the trilogy, I expected more and disappointed. Amish went into too much of detailing and dragged the story and in the end he collapses all your expectations. But any how worth reading once to complete the set.
I got this book cupl of weeks back from flipkart and i was so exited to read the final part of the shiva triology. Being frank,I liked the other two book more than the third part of the triology. I felt the third part slightly lacked in the thrill and the plot went slow. that was my feeling on it. And writing wise Amish did a great job just as in the other two books. I wont regret buying this one nor the previous two of the shiva triology.
It's great to see the surge in Jihadi novels and mythical trilogies. This is a great book too. And so is "Indians in Pakistan", a racy novel on terrorism - Read the preview at Pothi.com It is based in Pakistan and is an action thriller - there's an element of romance and patriotism in it too.
Thanks to flipcart for the good delivery. Really a masterpiece by the Indian author.It is equally good compared to the first two. It creates the interest in you as you go on reading this book.Really a good book to read.
Not upto the expectations compared to the first 2 books in the trilogy. Made it a very lengthy book by explaining minute details repeatedly. Also at the end of the book, it felt like author tried to conclude the book in a hurry. But overall it's fine and anyway you need to read this to complete the story and suspense. :)
The book seems very interesting at first, but later on, as the story progresses, it is mainly war, war and war. The ending isn't too appealing, and after reading it, it occurred to me that maybe the writer just wanted to finish the book. Though some portions are really very interesting and though Shiva continues to rock in this book too, the other characters fail miserably.
well it just did not end properly,felt like everything happened in a rush.and also hated the tragedy...................................................................................................................................................................................................................
well.. maybe its just me or maybe most of you feel this way.. The overall plot and the ravenous enthusiasm which was evolved as a result of the previous 2 books.. forced me to preorder this book.. but, it does not live upto its progenitors.. story is OK i Think.. but the ending was disappointing to an acme...
It looks like the author was in a hurry to finish off this series. I was disappointed by the pace through out. The beginning is fast enough but it slows down to a crawl and the plot doesn't go anywhere. The worst of it was the part where Shiva goes to the land of Rudra. The author starts off well but its as though he remembers that this is the last novel in the series and abruptly ends the setting. All in all it was not a fitting conclusion to the trilogy
i love this book. i have already finished this book. amazing story line. and too much links with prevoius parts. too insparing book. and open the vision of thinking. now fan of AMISH.. he is on the way to becoming Dan Brown -prafful sorani
I expected this book to be a history-mystical thriller. What it turned out to be was a tragedy. [Personal opinion] The character in the book often remind Shiva to win the battle the GOOD way to send a lasting image to the forthcoming generations but Shiva manages to do so taking the EVIL route.Worse, a main character in the story gets killed 'NINE straight chapters before the book is over'. After the character's death, it is just mourning,grief and sorrow. The war ends on its own. Shiva doesn't do anything to be revered ! Hats off Amish Tripathi for making me (and a whole lot of people) cry in the last nine chapters! Bottomline: If you are too compelled to read the concluding part of the Trilogy, just assume your favorite character died and thus ended a war. Nothing serious happens in this book.
The book is based on a theme that ' in revenge everybody losses'. The author has splendidly lifted the veil, revealing the mystery at a right pace. But the end as it should be is the most interesting part as what one expect to happen doesn't happen, concluding one of the most amazing and thrilling series of books.
Oath of the Vayuputras ne to du:khi kr diya yr! Matlab, last ki kahani itni pelu th ki ky bataun? Man du:khi ho gy yr! flipkart valo ki packing zabardast hoti h! Maza a jata hai book kholne main! Aur baqi k 200 characters k liye.................................. .................................................................................................................................................................................................. maan ki choot!
The book nicely portrays various human characterstics and how one emotion overpowers the other. Story buildup has probably got lost somewhere in trying to portray the relationship between many different tribes and civilization but it has done justice to the concept of "Shiva was a Man who walked in blood and flesh". The way in which various legends have been related and have been explained scientifically is just magnificent. The author promises to bring an untold version of "Mahabharta" and I think at least one copy is pre-booked.
i have only one word wow.. this is the last book of the Shiva trilogy and also more than 600 pages but after reading first two i completed it only in 3 days, while in case of last 2 it take me around 1 month to complete. end was ready unpredictable. i never thought about this end. a good & interesting book
It was an interesting read except for the fact that it was dragged a little too long towards the middle I had actually started skipping paragraphs. An unpredictable ending to the Shiva trilogy. Was expecting a more dramatic end to it. Unlike the first two books this one took a little long to finish, I would say the flow of the book was just not too gripping enough. But once you start something, you need to end it too, everything needs a closure, and that was the only thing which kept me going till the end.
Amish has a vivid imagination. Clubbed with our Hindu mythology, he has created a great novel which adds a different dimension to our past memories. The age old argument between Good and Evil was addressed very well and finished with a heart- wrenching account of the last fight. You finish the book with sadness in your heart, which was a bit unexpected. Overall a good read.
Wow !! .. the best was saved for the last .. Neelkanth completes what was destined on him to give a perfect ending. It starts well .. gets too slow in the middle and keeps dragging along till the end chapters and the climax. A series well written by Amish .. great work on his debut innings.
"The oath of Vayuputras" is the last book of the Shiva Trilogy by Amish. This also turn out to be another great book like it's previous two versions i.e. 'The Immortals of Meluha' & 'The Secret Of The Nagas'. Although some part of this books seems quite slow and more descriptive than usual eventful-flow. But overall this is simply a great book full of mystery, adventure and thrill. So, in one word this is a mast read book for all bookworm like me. This particular package is a wonderful offer provided by Flipkart. As always kudos to the Flipkart delivery system.
After reading the first 2 parts, I was eagerly waiting for the final part. Pre-Ordered it and received it on 26th Feb. Finished reading in two days. Here is what I felt. Excellent Start. Filled with action, drama and right amount of humor. An unexpected ending- too fantastic. Felt either Amish was too busy on other assignments and just wanted to finish it or he has tried to put too much into it.
From the first to the last, it seemed I was on a journey that has finally ended. With every chapter and with every page i could experience the thrill, action, love, rage and anger in me as i could witness everything that has been happening in it. I wept in the end and has a heavy heart but it also made me realize evil always ends and good lives forever. Over all the book has kept me glued to it at all points. very well written and narrated one can actually feel what is happening in it and will make you crave for it more and more. Some books always stay with you and it is indeed one such book. It will stay with me as long as i live. "A beautiful experience it has been." Thankyou Amish.
If 'The Immortals of Meluha' is splendid and 'The Secret of the Nagas' excellent, 'The Oath of the Vayuputras' is beyond words. Shiva's search for evil finally comes to an end and it is now time to remove it from the equation. The third part of the Shiva Trilogy shows the Neelkanth at the peak of his passion, wrath and sorrow. Many face the worst dilemmas of their lives as fate takes unexpected turns. I fell in love with the series right from the moment I started reading 'The Immortals of Meluha' and it was really difficult for me to part with the series even after I finished reading the third part. The book is both exciting and heart breaking and it is a must read for every book lover.
Its the most amazing Ending that can ever happen to a Trilogy.. A Definite Page Turner and I recommend all guyz out there to read this series. I got it the day after i ordered in a neatly packed form. It was the novel i had been eagerly waiting for. It couldn't be written in a more superb way.
The Final installment of Amish Tripathi's Shiva trilogy. For me, this books focus was overly skewed towards Geography and war strategy.The story seemed to take second place to these themes and the tying up of all lose ends. I guess the problem was that I was hoping for another Secret of the Nagas where the story telling moved forward at a brisk pace and was completely engrossing. While all the lose ends were effectively closed, I kept wanting more. There was nothing missing in Oath of the Vayuputras, but it just doesn't live up to Secret of the Nagas. I guess this is the problem with trilogies and series, not every author can be a George Martin or Tolkien whose each book keeps surpassing the previous one. The best part about Amish's stories is how he adapts legends and twists the stories to make them more plausible. The best example of that is in this book, in the episode on how Sati dies. Part 3 is not as enrapturing as part 2, but its definitely worth reading, because whatever said and done he is a good storyteller. So its a good thing that Amish has already signed up his next book deal, even though he isn't sure what he is going to be writing about. On a side note : It seems the translations are equally good. Inlaws are currently reading the series in Hindi and are eagerly awaiting the translation of Oath of the Vayuputras.
First of all, thanks for Flipkart for their excellent delivery... Had been waiting for this book since quite a time..but considering the first 2 books of the trilogy, this book has been a bit disappointing...the plot picks up at few occasions, but on other it lags..anyways worth a read..
i ordered this amazing finale of the trilogy on 10th june. The expected date of arrival was 13th, but i got it a date earlier, in good condition,and with a cool bookmark. about the book, series was awesome, but this one had become a bit predictable and monotonous. Though the 2nd half was much better. Kudos to Amish to bring such a change in the Indian literary sphere. my review for the book- 3.75/5 but flipkart gets a cool 5/5. good job people!
What an imagination, can say par our thinking. creation of lord Shiva through his own ideology and then keep moving and creating every scene like it happened in real. this trilogy series deserves everything. A worth to read in terms of imagination, plotting, character selection, narration and story style....!! Hats Off.
To start with, the flipkart service is amazing. I got the book two days later after buying and the book was shining like a mirror. Apart from that, coming to the content, I just want to say Amish has done an impeccable job. A complete paisa vasool.
it has been a joyous ride through the life story of one of our greatest Gods, Shiva. we saw him rise from the man to the God... after reading this book, i personally feel that Amish could have done a bit better with the ending. but nonetheless, it only shows us that our God is after all a human being...old habits (read nature) die hard. however, it stands out as one of the landmarks of modern indian english literature. after completing the series, i had one question in mind. have we really been underestimating the Mahadev for the last few millenia?
The shiva trilogy is a very god series of books to read. the author has created an amazing world with a mixture of fiction, reality and myth. But it is the story telling that did not keep the pace with the story. About this book, it a great book to read, you will definitely enjoy it And as always good service by flipkart
Truthfully I was bored by the 5th Chapter and then I skipped many chapters to reach the end. I was bored to the fact that the author placed in many fillers like the Japanese Animes but these were really boring fillers. He just screwed up a very good Tag story ( probably a excellent Hollywood Movie in the future if made by Christopher Nolan!!!). Anyways I would request the author to stick to the story than placing too many details which a reader does not care!!!
If you have read the first two parts, IMMORTALS OF MELUHA, and SECRET OF THE NAGAS, you will be expecting a superb climax end to this 3rd part too......... but lemme tell yew frankly, you are bound to be disappointed........ Though the battles have been described amazingly, the end brings a blemish on the character of Mahadev, one who yields to anger, and is unable to keep his promise.........
Great Book again. Just one word , Buy this trilogy. Its slow and non gripping in some parts but then which book or story isnt. Here he showed that a human with his karmas can become god, and god is nothing but just a human who to has emotions. Loved it because it defined god correctly, just like one of us. Dont miss these 3 book. Do make them a part of ur collection. Atleast one IIM writter to took a different shoes and wrote something senseful. Ameesh u r Paulo Coelho and DanBrown of East.
Wow! Incredible! Amazing! This book is DAMN awesome! Amish has written an epic! Very interesting book! Amish has got the best that could possibly be derived. I hope every generation gets an author like you. This book is a MUST READ. 5 / 5. If you haven't read The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of The Nagas then I'd say that read these parts first and then go on to buy this concluding part of the trilogy. ~Om Namah Shivaiy~
It appears to have become the fashion nowadays, for authors to devote possibly more effort in marketing their novels, than actually writing them. After all, one has to live as per one's times, and sadly, it seems our world today demands a liberal dose of self promotion. As a modern catch phrase goes "You should not just perform, but be seen to be performing"!! Amish has succeeded marvelously on the publicity front. Encomiums have flowed in galore; several of them bordering on massive hyperbole. For example, one gushing press review stated that his writing was India's answer to Lord of The Rings! (Never mind that poor Mr Tolkien is now probably turning over in his grave!). Therefore, when you start reading his books, you are already under an immense pressure to conform, and convince yourself that the books are fabulous. After all, your 'logical' mind will tell you, the books couldn't possibly have sold so many copies and raked in so much moolah if they were (gasp!!) mediocre, could they?? But such are the times we live in! A below average product, marketed with spin, vigor and chutzpah, succeeds better than other far superior offerings. The book has its good points (as did the two previous ones in the trilogy). Just that the careless writing, and the thoroughly poor editing almost drown out the good elements. Let's focus on the positives first. The quality of research put into this book has shown some improvement over the past two. For instance, the author uses a conversation between the 'Vasudev' priest Gopal and Shiva, to explain how in the Avestic culture (which he calls 'Pariha' --modern day Iran), the concept of gods and demons are mirror images of the Vedic ones. Therefore, the Avestic gods are the 'Ahuras', the inverse of the Vedic demons- the Asuras. The Avestic demons are the 'Daevas', the inverse of the Vedic gods- the Devas. (Incidentally, 'demons' is probably an incorrect term to use here; in those times, neither culture demonized the Asuras or the Daevas, merely treating them as another form of divinity.) I still remember the deep sense of wonder I felt, when I first read of the similarity and dichotomy between the Vedic and Avestic philosophies, in an article by the great writer Dr Devdutt Pattanaik. So kudos to Amish, for incorporating this startlingly beautiful nugget of information into this novel. However, the language Amish makes his characters speak continues to jar. It is just so irritating to read of highly revered figures set in ancient times, speaking modern slang. 'Chill', 'Hell, Yes' and even worse, swear words, which I do not want to put down here! Moreover, three times in quick succession in a single paragraph, there is talk about how some people may have 'aligned with the Neelkanth'. It looks so odd to see the same phrase being used again and again within the same para! This is a problem encountered throughout this trilogy, where glitches that could so easily have been corrected at the editing stage, are retained in the final copy. The book also suffers from character and plot inconsistency. Ganesh, Karthik and Bhrigu, for example, make nearly 180 degree turnarounds in their essential characteristics and beliefs, without so much as batting an eyelid, let alone any internal debate. The plot itself, after plodding and meandering quite a bit, seems to be in a tearing hurry to come to a closure towards the end. Several threads are therefore just left hanging in the air. The closing paras of the book indicate, that the author is now taking up the Mahabaratha for his next work. One would like to wish him all the best for that, but also to hope that he makes his writing much less clunky, in order to do a semblance of justice to such a Great Epic.
Yesterday i completed reading the last part of this wonderful series. I think the biggest usp of this series until the climax of the book was how Amish used the popular known facts about shivji and his family to write a fictional account about his journey from a tribal leader to a living god. Amish excels in creating a wonderful imaginary world of different tribes their cultures their cities their beliefs molding all of it into a brilliant fictional india in 1900 BC The first two books were excellent almost as good as some of the best fantasy/fictional novel authors could have imagined. The third part reveals the true evil quickly and then shiva decides to make a well though out plan to eliminate the evil from its roots without causing too much damage. Contrary to popular opinion here i did not find anything wrong in amish dedication 50% of the book in strategizing, planning going to convince other people to join shiva in the war. When you are about to declare a war as big as this you need forge alliances, startegize plan, fightt mini battles, lay traps to confuse the opposition,it's all part of the process. The moral and ethical conflicts some major characters faced in choosing between shiva and their kingdom is also well written The description of fights, the technology/science used behind the ships/weapons/battle formations are well written and much needed. However where the book fails is a. doesn't convince me still that shiva should be seen as god if you overlook the "neelkanth" prophecy b. the choice of evil is a dampner c. third and most prominent mistake is resorting to the well known goddess sati's mythological story to make a hasty ending. I however agree with shiva seeking revenge, but then again we already know the mytho story behind sati's death and lord shiva's retribution. The ending was extremely sad and depressing and in my view the whole concept of destroying evil goes out of the equation, which was the premise of the whole series.
One of the finest book series ever. As one of the other reviews, this books makes u feel Shiva as your Friend. Cannot think that it is a fiction. Author has narrated the story very nicely. All characters, situations, the attires, everything has been described very nicely which you can easily imagine and feel. Great Story, plenty to learn in the form of Human values and Dharma. Highly Recommended for all.
A very great work by Amish .Clearly defining why we worship Shiva. Intermingling with emotions of different persons and a terrific end to the story has made it a top choice for readers. A unexpected turn around of events meant that Shiva had to return to Melhua to finishhis undone job. But then life would not be same for Shiva.
this book was nothing like the first two books.. i missed the fast pacedness of the first two books..it was very lengthy and dragged on and on.. then suddenly when author realized it has become too long, he wrapped it up too suddenly. the climax was the most disppointing part.. i was looking forward to the book quite excitedly but its was really disappointing..
The trilogy ended in the perfect combination of war, EVIL, revenge, death, love.. Made me an ardent of Shiva even more. Found it slow at times, but caught up pace at the right time! Hats off to Amish! Worth a read to the suspense filled trilogy.
good series. But had a disappointing end, where shiva, the great neelakanth , who were supposed to hold to his karma, lost his vision at his personal loss. otherwise, it was really an amazing experience to "live" in it..
The book reciprocates, last two books in term's of success, its capacity to hold the readers at edge. once you start, it doesn't feel to stop. As compared two the last books, this one is massive in term's of its length. But it really has the flow going. Unexpected turn of event's is the main theme based, which changes the story flow. Amish you are one hell of a writer.
It somehow lacked the sophistication of the previous books, this. Amish does his best to untie most of the knots from the previous books in the trilogy; but half-way through it seems as though the drive had been lost, resulting in an unsatisfying, hastened ending. Nevertheless an interesting read and a page-tuner.
Wow! Worth the wait. I enjoyed reading every page. The book just kept me dumbstruck the way Amish had had imagined so many things out of the blue that seems far away from what one could ordinarily imagine. Going forward, I'll read every book this Author writes. Of course, I'd be ordering them via Flipkart. Simple, Convenient & best way to shop.
Now, all i can say, Amish started it very well, but could not match the end. The first two books were very interesting and too much was there. But in the final one, it disappointed me. Making the evil in an abrupt manner and finishing it in more abrupt manner. Mr. Tripathi must have done a long and thorough research, but i think he could not give this epic a good finishing.
Its a mixture of Romance,Thriller,Suspense.Amish did an awesome job by making it so much interesting that you might want to finish the book in one read.The trilogy is a must read book series.i hope that Amish will come up with another interesting series...
nothing more than a page after page description of one battle after another. While the first few pages of the first battle are exciting, it doesn't take long for monotony to surface and soon your mind is more attracted to the authors shortage of vocabulary, honestly he uses words like 'flank' and 'pirouetted' more times than a toddler uses the word mama! Why even his unique and interesting style of incorporating modern sciences into age old methods of life starts bordering on the impossible and so starts testing your patients.
Ordered the trilogy as the book got released in the market. And Flipkart delivered the book in couple of days. Package was good, Bookmarks were awesome, Timely Delivery. This Trilogy has re-started the habit of reading in me.
though a little bit filmy, but it captures the reader to keep turning over to the next page. brilliant explanation on what is evil and the line between good and evil, very true to the ideologies expressed in our scriptures. and a good , thought less than suitable end . Good story, and good way of narration, average english, read it for the story and not the language. He is a banker turned writer, so don't expect literary masterpiece like Moby dick
i just loved the triology...the plots, description, language, everything was perfect to me..and the services by flipkart..take the 5 stars :-D amazing...no of pages concerned, they are not going to hinder the reader's interest at any point of time. i read the first book and third book with same levels of energy and enthusiasm(infact more ) P.S i love those funny bookmarks :-)
When you start reading a series, wait obviously becomes the part of the deal. I waited almost impartiality for this part to arrive. almost checking every week for it. I liked it almost till the last 100 ages left but somehow I felt that story got concluded in a bit haste and left some loose ends, Some thirst to quench. But truly enjoyed the journey and never regret in started reading it. Amish came a long way when it comes to writing and he is our Indian version of Jeffrey Archer, he will be a fine story teller. I will look forward more of his work. Happy Reading.
After a brilliant 'Immortals of Meluha' and a good 'Secret of the Nagas', author Amish Tripathi really lets us down with what can only be explained as a 50 page book, stretched to 550 pages and then culminated into an ending that is the epitome of convenience. The book which promises to resolve the plethora of knots created throughout the first two books is nothing more than a page after page description of one battle after another. While the first few pages of the first battle are exciting, it doesn't take long for monotony to surface and soon your mind is more attracted to the authors shortage of vocabulary, honestly he uses words like 'flank' and 'pirouetted' more times than a toddler uses the word mama! Why even his unique and interesting style of incorporating modern sciences into age old methods of life starts bordering on the impossible and so starts testing your patients. Coming to the end, without revealing the story, I have to say that it uses probably the most ridiculous device i have ever read in the book to resolve the the basic story line built up in the first two books. It is clear that Mr Tripathi started writing this story without any idea of an ending in mind and has been forced into thinking up one in a hurry, probably because of publisher pressure. Read the book only so that you get a closure for the story. If you are stronger than me and can move on with your life without knowing the ending then I envy you and I hope I could have done the same! On an unrelated note, Flipkart surpassed itself this time. A whole lot of us had pre ordered the book from various places, I got mine like a week before anyone else! :D
The gross twisting of facts to justify mythology in first two parts was bearable and even interesting but he got so carried away in glorifying a community that it is illogical and unbearable to read especially after reading "THE ASURAS".
What a magician ! you just live THE SHIVA by going through the amazing web created with masterly interwoven plots. You just wait whats going to happen next. Although the expectations were too high , but Amish lives upto that. Just can't wait for Mahabharata !!
FLIPKART never fails to impress with its service. Keep it up people. The first impression of the book comes from its sheer size compared to the two previous books. And yet the book never does get boring. A bit slow paced than the two others. But an overall great end to a thrilling trilogy.You discover true love,courage,bravery,patriotism,righteousness and much more in the course of the book. Well done AMISH!! Impressive trilogy for a new author!!
exceptional book ....... more than just fiction..........seems to be reality...... modern concepts used.............grand finale for shiva triology............hats off author Amish .............. lovely book
A quite long book, comparing with the other two, but fantastically written. Full with messages, thrills, wars with immense blood and gore, love and kisses, human emotions and even Egyptian myth, this book will entertain you till the last page! Though the ending may have not completely satisfied some(according to their reviews), for those who know the original myth, it would be icing o the cake. Must read!
Loved the 1st half of the book, the 2nd half was a page flipping exercise - dull & lacking in every aspect. The end was abrupt & left a lot to be desired. Will think twice before picking up Amish's next book
Unlike the previous 2 books, this one is very slow. Looks like pages to pricing ratio played a major role. Author has used cliche's from internet which takes away the charm (e.g frog in boiling water) from reading the story. Too much time wasted in detailing things that do not add anything to the overall story.
After reading the first 2 books I had expected this to be a great experience but it did not live up to expectation. It bored me at some points with many pages of unnecessary battle description. But still I like Amish's innovative thinking as he told the story of shiva in the way we never would've thought of. I still recommend this book if you have read the first 2 books.
Absolutely loved the final book of the Shiva Trilogy. It has been a fascinating and exciting journey from the start to the end of our travels with the Neelkanth. A mix of ancient spiritual insights, complex characters and great descriptions of warfare as it was then, love and deceit and murder and grief. However, it IS part of a trilogy and cannot be read in isolation, unlike some other examples of serial writing. If you haven't read any of Amish's books, don't wait! Order the trilogy right away.
The wait was EXCRUCIATING The order was SWIFT (PRE-ORDERED) The delivery was GOOD The story was GREAT until the ending chapters where it became DULL, PREDICTABLE and hence The last book of the trilogy became a DAMPENER
since beginning war is glorified and at the end its nullyfied just like one man show as in bollywood movies.....last 100 pages are the most boring part of all...their are no twists as in part I and II,fully cinematic.after reading I and II book i was expecting a lot form III,but it disappointed a lot...the EVIL is SOMRAS itself is not satisfactory..
Fascinating and emotional end to a very successful book series. Amish Tripathi's writing style is free flowing and elegant! The story in particular delivers a great message that a person can become God through his karma! Amish has delivered this message in a very subtle manner. Oath of the Vayuputras is a bit slow to start off with but it picks pace half way through. Lord Shiva or The Neelkanth continues his journey in search of evil and I must say this book takes me by surprise when He finds out that evil has existed right where he begins His journey! Amish has also hinted what could possibly be his next series of novels at the end of the book. All in all a great triology!
I just happened to finish this book and I must admit it takes you through a range of human emotions.. Love, duty, compassion,anger. You are not just anxious as to what will happen next, it is definitely a book that grips you. The trilogy is awesome. You love Shiva and Sati and experience the wide range of emotions surging through you. A must read for those who have read the Meluha and Nagas for the questions are unanswered if you don't read this. Also the experience was so good that I want this to stay with me for some time before I pick another book
After reading the first two parts of the Shiva Trilogy, I expected much more in this book. But, the author has lost the plot. Too much of explanations that drags and drags. But, the climax is brilliant. The authors words doesn't have that power to bind you with the book itself. I finished the first two books in just a week. I took this one about ten days ago and still not able to go beyond 100 pages. Having read the previous books, I have no choice but to finish the series. To put in simple words, it feels like Ekta Kapoor's never ending television soap.
i got the book with high expectations riding on it from the previous books. however, i am convinced that the plot simply thins out from the 1st book (which is riveting) to 2nd(more comic book like) and finally the 3rd book (i could feel tht the author wrote visualising the book as a movie)... the book dwells too much on inconsequential details and is a let down since the huge build up to the end battle simply fizzles out as a no show... the book was more 'karan joharesque' (i couldnt think of a bigger insult for the book) than the 1st book which had a raw appeal to it..which i believe was its USP the author seemed to be under some kind of performance related anxiety and seemed to have written the book just because story was touted as a trilogy and not because the story required this book overall - DISAPPOINTING!!!
Amish's The Oath of Vayuputras is a very disappointing book, after having waited so long to read this - very disappointing. It seems he was desperate to write a sequel so he did without any logic or meaning, though its a work of fiction. Hes very repetitive at times especially when he talks of Good vs Evil. I think he has taken readers for granted after the success of his earlier two books. Will think twice before buying his next book. Too much of violence, too much of war strategy which is meaningless. He has made our great mythological characters look like cartoons. Its too long a book, could have been shorter by atleast 100 pages. Its takes about 150 pages for it to take off. Final word - if you feel that the trilogy will be incomplete without this book then let it be incomplete.
Its a beautiful journey with shiva trilogy. All the books of the series was brilliantly cenceptualized and well written but i personally disappointed with the ending. I won't go much into the story line but the way the shiva charecter has been described from the first book, it didn't reached the level of expectation. overall it was a great journey except the last chapter of the last book.
Personally felt very bad at the end of the novel , could have tried something else. If you havent read this book pleae do read it i am sure you will skip most of the conversations and arrive at the Actions . Om namah shivay
I am stunned as how in the name of the holy lake you got the Idea of this awesome book,Amish!It's enrapturing,soul provoking and has got a philosophy of it's own type.Heaven knows if I'll ever be getting the honour again to read a book like this!A must read.
The most perfect ending to a mind blowing trilogy. Every detail is covered, no place is left for doubts or confusion. The action is vivid and the emotions are heart wrenching. Amish Tripathy has done a fabulous job without any doubt.
Firstly, this books does not disappoint you. After having read the first two parts you just cannot wait to lay your hand on this. This book is so well written.The suspense,thrill,emotions are well maintained through out. I would highly recommend this trilogy for all the fiction/fantasy lovers.
The story continues but with less effect .................... Its more like a script of a movie "Filmy stuff" lots of drama .................. But still a good ending to the trilogy........................................
A very enjoyable read. Amish has, in very simple language, brought forth the true message of the Vedas and the Mahabharat - honor, dignity, truth, loyalty, service to mankind and love of God. Jai Jai Sri Ram
I ordered Part 1 & 2 from Flipkart and was highly impressed with both the books. But it indicated that Shiva will do something which will force us to accept him as a God. But nothing happened. Whole of the suspense was revealed at the start of this Part 3. So rest of the book was just a read. You will read second half of the book only because you want to finish the story after reading 2.5 novel.
You might end up with a little gap in your appetite after reading the final book of the triology, but then, we have started expecting nothing less than mastepiece evrytime Amish picks up the pen to write. Having said that,you'll find, especially second half of the book high in affinity. The book never loses that special intriguing-mythological-charm we have been experiencing since the first book. Great storyline but the pace is very broadly maintained this time than on the small incidences. Climax, especially the war sequence of Sati was one the best pieces i've ever read. For those who have read the earlier two parts, i guess its impossible for you to leave it out. For rest, your reading will alwas be incomplete without this trioligy. As for flipkart its like an old buudy now. We don't praise it anymore like the old timesyet we know it does best what it does for us!
After reading the first 2 installments of this trilogy, I'm waiting eagerly to start this final book. I am sure that this book as the other 2 have will not disappoint me. Flipkart has a done a good job of delivering it to me in 3 days.
I have read the earlier two parts of the triology and was impressed with Amish's style of writing and his ability to combine mythological facts with a fictional story. I was anyhow dissapointed with the ending of this third book. Overall a good set of books to read. It feels good to see new generation of writers in the indian fiction arena which was occupied earlier with the likes of RK Narayan, Ruskin Bond etc..
Kudos To Flipkart for prompt delivery. Read this Book but it was not upto expectation. Melhua is 4 star Nagas is 5 Star but oath is 3 Star. It is not engrossing like Nagas. The end was too disappointing after reading about war in the entire book I wanted the end to be much more better and not in a hurry. Definitely first two books were far better.
It is one of the best Trilogies I've ever read in my entire life.A few years back I just kept seeing Amish's books placed in various Bookstores & Libraries across the city & wondered what this book is all about & I'm glad to have purchased each & every one.The story & it's subsequent Build-up was Fantastic & scintillating right from Pg.1 to Pg.556.Once again,Best Trilogy. Hands Down.Kudos to Amish!! A Must Read for sure. P.S.Thank You Flipkart for delivering the book on the subsequent day of its release.
Scaled heights. Each word has emanated from Shiva himself. Amazing synchronization of various cultures. The words were creating characters of karma from self. Tears flowed with joy and amusement and sorrow! I pray God brings his BEST from this great author! An avatar of Trilogy and a trendsetter of his OWN. Never miss it. The third part made me read 1 and 2 pumping great spirits!
I was quick to pre order the book as soon as it came up. When I received the copy, it just took me less than 48 hours to finish it up. With every book, I personally feel the writing of Amish has improved and the story has become more gripping. Was bit let down by the way the book ended, as it looked more cinematic. But other than that it is a wonderful read for all the people who love Shiva!
This book launched long back but I am getting time now to read and review. First of all congratulations to author for such a master piece and keeping readers waited for so long to read this book. Now about the Book: The way first part was written, the way second part came out I expected that the third part of this trilogy will be also full of ups and downs and thrills. But you know what...excess of everything is bad. Similarly Author has tried to dramatized excessively in this book, that after 200-300 pages you start getting the feel of exaggeration like any Hindi cinema. I am not reveling any story part of the book, else you will not enjoy the book. But I have commented the style of writing as compared to first two parts. Though I am now a huge fan of Amish but I feel this part of the book could have been much better if Amish would have kept it crisp and to the point. Loads of drama and ups and downs, surprises and unexpected climax of the Shiva Trilogy. An Finally Flip kart service is as awesome as it used to be in 2008, since I am one of the oldest buyers of Flipkart. All said and done, please neglect all the reviews and grab a copy. I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AFTER YOU FINISH.
Amish has started the best way to portray the mythological characters in alternate history. I have read first two parts and became big fan of the series. As far as last part concerns I have received it an hour back. I read first 40 pages, and I am sure that it is much more interesting than first two parts. Waiting for actual movie based on the trilogy..
Loved his writing. The way he creates the background, the way he describes the specs, the way he wrote the first 2 parts. I was loving this one like the others but was disappointed in the end. Still kudos to Amish.
Alothough I am still on my way to finish this book, I can't keep myself from writing a review, The book is wonderful, Thank u Amish for one more treat to your fans. This time a lil bigger and fatter one :) And Flipkart you are equally wonderful. Delivery on a single day ! Thats really really worth praising. Your packing, services and discounts, leaves no chance of grievances.
The oath of the vayuputras The concluding narrative of shiva triology is so packed that it causes indigestion. From the assasins of Egypt to the Lhasa Lamaâ€™s the author has tried to squeeze in too many things. The incomplete legend of Tripuradahana, the tale of Brihaspati and Tara, Bhagirathaâ€™s channelizing the water of Ganga, unfortunately the author has transferred the operation ot Yamuna.
Awesome book, well written.....will keep you binded with the story till the end....A MUST READ for book lovers!!!!!!!!!!well connected you go on reading one after anaother n will will keep u involved in the story!!!!!!!!!hats of to Amish!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Trilogy started off extremely well conceived (let's call it Brahma), the second part (The Vishnu) was well constructed, and the third part (The Mahesh) came into a decent climax. A little more conscious writing in the last few pages (The Epilogue ) would have created a far better impact. Perhaps the movie makers (Karan Johar?)could fine tune this part. In any case it is a great beginning of readings about our heritage for my generation.
The whole journey of Shiva is mind blowing.But the end could have been better.
Amish has written a book which keeps you spell bound. Every page is exciting and you wish to read more and more. Have read all the three parts and just can resist myself. It keeps you attracted all the time. Waiting for the next book to come out from him.....
Having read the previous 2 books i had great expectations from the third one ....... After reading about 500 i was convinced that it is just OK book but on redaing the whole book ..... Really poorly written ending ....... Buy this book but dont expect a masterpiece
The third and final one has disappointed me. Number of pages has been increased to make the book fat and to charge more but pace has become very slow and nothing interesting happens in this part. Even you can predict how it will all end. This part is no match to the Immortals of Meluha. I hope a fresh and new book will come in future from this skilled author.
This book was not a page turner like the previous one.The book contained a high quantity of DRAMA with less thrill.Sometimes the pages were really became monotonous.But some of the chapters were too good.Altogether the book could be better if it was more compact. But this book had a power to force the reader to turn the page. Overall the book is GOOD but not TOO GOOD.
It's a great book to read... But it has a certain number of loopholes... In the first book, when shiva sees sati for the 1st time, sati seems familiar to him. But where has he seen him? I'm still curious. And the dream of Shiva (the man with huge beastly hair and all other adult stuff) were in fact of no use at all. i expected that that dream would be explained in this book, but it's not! Finally the ending... Please don't expect a huge Harry Potter ending with thousands of people fighting and all. I dont wanna be a huge spoiler(even though i've given some spoilers), it doesn't have such a epic and happy ending... Verdict: Amish could have written it better. It seems he has hastily finished this book without thinking patiently
The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3 â€¦.A very well written fiction. â€¦another grate book by Amrishâ€¦ this is simply a great book full of mystery, adventure and thrill. So, in one word this is a mast read book for all. Best Series released in INDIA. . :) Must Read. . :)
not very satisfied with the last book,had great expectations after reading the first and the second trilogy,had even expected that the last book would be the best of the other two but the book was a bit blur and diverted itself from the main theme,it was more into philosophy.
A very well written fiction. A fitting end to the stories created in the first two books. It also give a peek into what the author has in his mind for future. Only a very few surprises in the plot at this stage. But follows a typical trilogy pattern where the final book is more about tying the story together rather than creating new turns and twists. Liked it a lot.
Finally, the book was over... The length of "Oaths of Vayuputras" is enormous...At times, the pace is quite slow. The preparations and strategies for wars may be interesting or slow, depending on the taste of the reader. Numerous war scenes lend a real touch. The defeat of Magadh is to be mentioned specifically for the violence and gore...but then the author goes on to explain the title to Karthik as Lord of Wars. The third in the series is not able to keep with the excitement and novelty of the two prequels...the primary reason being predictability that comes with the prequels. Character of Sati has been defined more clearly in this last of the Shiva Trilogy. Sati seems alter ego of Durga in the final book. But Author has somehow not done much justice to Kali's character, which is a disappointment. Like the previous two, the book is full of contradictions. Kuru is mentioned somewhere but the book ends with explaining events leading to Mahabharata. And many other contradictions too... By the time, one is through with Shiva Trilogy, the contradictions start becoming a little too overwhelming. Humanizing Shiva and his contemporaries, explaining their characters by means of their lives is a novel experience. Over all, "Oath of Vayuputras" is a must read to complete the trilogy. No expectations from literary angles, no historical authenticity but an experience in itself, that's what Shiva Trilogy is.
The book is nice to read, showing some good writing skills at few points but the ending was not as great as it could have been. There was much more scope of a better ending. I was expecting some more secrets to be revealed. Third book is not the best one, but the complete triology together is a must read...
Amish's first two books were too good that i read both of them in a stretch.But in the new one that is The Oath of the Vayuputras,there was something missing in it.i had a feeling that many things which he said in the book were not important at all.But overall the books is good.it has got a gripping story and Amish has told the story well.A good ending for an epic series.
I enjoyed reading all the 3 books and though the 3rd one is bit long it would keep you guessing what next. The ending is different from what we may have expected but that's what make this one different. I wish this entire triolgy is made as a movie Expecting the next book from Amish
It's a must read book. keeps us intrigued. I was fascinated reading the trilogy. I couldn't wait to turn over each page as the story is beyond imagination penned in a simplistic way.The book depicts our rich culture clubbed with the finest technological aspects. The trilogy is a must read for any book lover. Right from the the 1st part the book the storyline had me hooked until the last word of the 3rd part And not to forget the excellent service of flipkart who delivered the product in less then 2 days which is commendable
The delivery by flipkart was fantastic as usual.recieved it within 2 days.But the book is not such a good read. its an average effort on the authors part.the author gets carried away at times and has not done justice to the hero of the story. There are absolutely no heroics by the hero in this part. had read the first 2 parts of the triology so needed to know the ending even after average reviews but disappointed in the end.
A long read, but a good read. The way Amish has characterized his characters is just amazing. Takes the reader to a different world, definitely different from what we have heard since childhood and what has been foretold under mythology. After reading all the 3 books, must tell that Amish is an exemplary story teller. Lots of research has gone into in narrating this story. The narrative is something which I'll remember for sometime.
The personification of Shiva is truly bought out very well the way the book ends..!! Curiosity just keeps rising and the eventful storyline keeps reader grasped. It is very touchy how things proceed after 'The Event' that changes the course. It grasped my feelings for weeks after finishing the book too..! Go ahead read it and experience the personification.
Amish is a fabulous story teller. Every scene brilliantly written. Won't talk much about the story as it may reveal the secrets. But yes, you will surely love the final part if you enjoyed the first 2 parts. I didn't expected the end to be the way it was, but it is justifiable. Too much detailed description sometimes make you feel to skip it and directly jump to the action part. The secrets revealed hold some logic and are not introduced just for the sake of making it a thriller.
Best book in the Shiva trilogy. Was unable to keep the book down until I finish it. Fast, violent, and in the end explains a little why "few" gods are worshiped more in some parts of India than other. I am hopeful of Mahabharat will be coming out in few years from Amish. Hats Off
it was a good and unexpectable journey from the land of INDIA and an best end which could be written for the national bestseller shiva trilogy . during it's start it was quite slow, but the slow start was needed so that a good battle could be shown . every character has it's own different nature . all the battle are shown with a lot of bloodshed. it's end is completely written according to the shivpuran bt with a mixture of real story. battle between sati and egyptian is very brutule and after it's really very emotion .. complete was perfect for the ending book and if will be made in a movie definately this trilogy will give a tough competition to LOTR . finally just wanna conclude that go for it . if u wnt a different and action pack novel then go fr it
After rising the expectations in the first to books i felt third one the concluding one was below expectation. But still over all the 3 books makes a great reading. Ending could have been more interesting and creative.
Flipkart is deteriorating day by day..... Never expected this bad packing from them. This book is not that grasping like the previous two.... Amish could not keep up with the expectation this time.....
This book was a good ending to the Shiva Trilogy, but could have been made much shorter by Amish. Could have easily reduced 100 pages without losing on story line at all. Otherwise the book was a good read and closed all the loose ends from the previous two books.
Great Trilogy by Amish...It plays in the mind like actual events have happened right before me...The amount of research done by Amish is truly appreciable...Awaiting the movie based on these books & awaiting more books from the Author...Keep it up!!
Hi All, I was fortunate enough to get hold of the book on the day it released (I prebooked :P). Had a lot of expectations as Amish had left a lot of questions to be answered in the last installment. The book has a good flow and the narrative is brilliant. The downside is it does not answer all the questions and there are a lot more loopholes here. Where the first 2 books were gripping this one tends to drag on a bit. Nevertheless an excellent trilogy awaiting the other series from Amish. You should definitely read the first two books and to bring the story to its logical conclusion you have to read the third one as well :). Flipkart keep up the good work!!
The book is very beautifully written. Putting the characters in a well defined manner. The book is having politics, war, love and sacrifice framed beautifully. Its a must read book. It is really difficult to stop reading the book when started.
The book was good but it was dragging at some parts... I would say Amish has done justice to his trilogy overall... certain fight sequence were beautifully described by him. Few unexpected twist made the book really interesting at end. Hope the author comes up with similar interesting series in the future.
A must read for those who have followed the Shiva trilogy. Although not the best book in the series, its a fitting finish to the trilogy. I found the book extremely good in patches, may be a bit stretched in the middle, especially the portions describing the war (but that was inevitable I guess). I liked the end of the book. A little unorthodox, but very sensible, just like the whole series. And about the service from flipkart .. impeccable, as usual.
What he did in Immortals of Meluhas and the Secret of the Nagas, He UNDID in Oath....Slow, predictable and at times, very boring. I got confused at times, if I was reading a novel or a book on Philosophy ???????????
As usual Amish talks about many mythological things which we often dont know. Lo of Scientific explanations to many basic things of Hinduism. Its always a learning experience. But I find the middle part in the book very boring. its very dramatic. Its lack soul. It would have been great if the book is around 450 pages instead of 550+. But over all its a satisfying experience especially which the climax which is quite unexpected.
What a sappy ending to such a promising series. Amish's writing style in the first two books was a breath of fresh air among Indian authors. However, in this last installment, it is just plain irritating. The use of adjectives without justification, mindless warfare (unlike the first one) and the incredibly disappointing ending (probably this is personal though) makes it a total let down. However, I will keep an eye on Amish's books in the future. I hope he can recreate the magic that was the first two parts of the Shiva trilogy.
After Secret of Nagas I was expecting shiva to fulfill his legacy or something but instead, I get a full scale in-depth description of strategic battles throughout the book. Vayuputra tribe is severely underrepresented and book is a major let down. Read this book just to finish this trilogy..
The strengths of the precedents make this book a let down. The plot of the story is revealed within the first ten pages which make the story very predictable. The subtle moral and philosophy conveyed in the story were the one that have driven my interest in this trilogy. But, this book has nothing more than mediocre politics. The strength of this trilogy are: - Weaving a fiction based on characters known from mythology and preserving their characterization along with significance of the geographical locations is a splendid effort. - An attempt to correlate the myths and superstitions of the community to science is impressive. - The central theme of the story 'good and evil lie together and one evolve from another' Overall, this concluding book in the series in not enthralling as its predecessors.
This is a good book, final and neat ending to the trilogy. I was quite disappointed with the Nagas part, after Amish had raised the expectations to super heights with the Part one. He definitely did justice to the 3rd part. Super good writing. Loved the episodes of Parveteshwar's dillema, Ganesh and Karthik's bonding, Sati's strong characterization and Shiva's love for her. Wish every Indian reads the trilogy to understand mythology can be so well presented. These 3 books could very well be mythology for the generations 1000 years later! :)
excellent book. as much as i liked reading it , so much i liked holding this book in my hands. superb quality paper and cover with outstanding binding. a must read for all interested in indian mythology and lord shiva. but to understand the book you must go through the first 2 parts of the triology. immortals of meluha and seccret of nagas
All the beauty and wonder that Amish built around Shiva in his first two books was completely destroyed in this one. I don't know how characters became so unpredictable. Moreover trying to justify all the legends in a haste sounds very unaesthetic and leaves a very bad taste in the mind of the readers
I bought this book with a high expectation after reading first two parts. But I turned out nothing. Third part is nothing compared to 1st and 2nd books. Really boring climax and sudden ending. Really boring wasted my time. Don't waste your money on this book.
A very nice end to the trilogy... though was a little boring towards the beginning, Amish has done a great job. Though some times you may feel that in the process of tying all the lose ends, he has gone into a detailed explanation which slows down the story.
Amish Tripathi begins the Shiva Trilogy series with a massive bang! The first i.e. The Immortals of Meluha, was and continues to remain the best of the three. The second (The Secret Of The Nagas), was I felt, a massive let down. The third in the series (this one), was an improvement over the second but fails the reach the literary heights of first. Personally, I feel that after the success of The Immortals of Meluha, Amish concentrated too much on promos and less on writing a hard-hitting sequel to the first. All the same, if you've read the first then you canâ€™t help but buy the other two. The three together are ideal to take with you on a holiday.
Amish has provided a good mix of a good story and philosophy in the third edition of the Shiva trilogy. It makes an interesting read with all secrets of previous books being revealed. The details of battle scenes is simply amazing. The issue of good vs evil has been dealt with in great depth. This is probably the best part of the book â€“ what is the real evil and how Shiva goes about trying to bring an end to it. Vasudev pandits are an interesting lot. My favourite part is the depiction of mythological characters and the interpretation why they are seen as gods and goddesses. The scientific explanation of every aspect makes it a delightful book. It is a nice book for people interested in some interesting philosophy and those who wanna know the complete story after the first two books. However, it is not a classic. I consider the Shiva trilogy a must read. It is a great package. Kudos to Amish Tripathi.
the first word i would say after reading just half way thru is a big WOW. amish gives such great advices in the most mild but imprinting way, like take it, live it and ur country's treasures are saved and so are u along with it. most of what i read in the book is relevent to today's scenario. a review can be big n elaboraate, but i feel this book ie part 3 of shiva trilogy, has satisfied me than any book of novel type i have read so far.
The Story was good but couldn't live up to the expectation set by the previous books. While the story was good there were moments where there were unwanted details. The entire part of the journey to pariha and the events there were not needed. Finally the name OATH OF THE VAYUPUTRAS was not justified because they didn't play any part in the plot except handing over shiva the pasupatastra also the vasudevs whose army was introduced to be a mighty one were of no use in the main battle. I would give it 3 star.
Am a big fan of his first two novels, whilst the first two gave a feel of immense plot and page turners, I think this one is more cinematic and written purposely with the intention of later being developed into a film. However it would suit as a film, and for a book its really dull. The first half is kind of slow and needs a lot more convincing, however second half is good! The big problem i am yet to understand is that shive the destroyer of evil ... ya good, but right throughout everyone seems to be applauding him, but most of his deeds are a result of advices and gestures from someone... ! anyways a good entertainer.
I am surprised at the level of positive feedback this piece of literary absurdity is getting. The first two books in this series were at least interesting from a story line point of view. There was something "refreshing" especially in the whole premise of "nagas" and the portrayal of Lord Shiva as a "tibetan barbarian" and his weed smoking and attitude. However, this third book is bad, and it gets terrible towards the end. Here are five reasons why we should consider this as one of the worst pieces of fiction ever written: 1. The sheer incompetence of the author to appreciate what Shiva is. (I am not writing more details on the story ....). Amish is good at setting himself up and Shiv bakth in his forward and media utterances. However, he has not even understood what Shiva stands for. Using Shiva's "anger" as an excuse for the actions he makes him do is unforgivable to anyone who believes in God, in Shiva 2. The description and the language used in conversations (like the use of purely 21st century American slang by our ancients) is pathetic. 3. The book's ending looks so forced.. it is as if the writer did not know what to do at the end. 4. While it is okay to take literary liberties, the twisting of what is accepted and what is written in our ancients texts, has gone beyond all reasonable levels 5 There unbelievable amount of gore... especially in the fighting scenes towards the end. I dont know if this author has read any of the classics that depicted warfare and fighting. 6. I see may reviewers indicating that Amish has flushed out his characters. Yes - he did that in Book 1 (especially with Shiva, Sati, Bhadra, Parvateshwar), but in this book, many of the characters are so one sided and shallow The biggest crime is that such books are unfortunately shadowing really good fiction that keeps coming out of authors across India, especially from the regional languages. It is so sad that publishing has become nothing but smart marketing.....
After reading the first 2 books, I was eagerly waiting for this 3rd book for almost more than 8 months. After reading the book, I felt it is is a complete let down of the interst and excitement built by the previous books. The 2nd half of the book is truely boring and I simply turned the pages without reading. The war story defintely could have been curtailed. The end is unexpected and it appears that the author has hurriedly written to shoehow end this book.
Good book a must read but, I think ending is written in haste... I brought this book and in 3 days time( excluding holidays) it got delivered to my doorstep. Good delivery flipkart. All over it's a great thriller and u feel that u are watching a movie on this book because it it explained so good and every page reveals and hides secret. Mainly action parts are explained with crystal-clarity. But ending does disappoints as it is concluded in haste and not becoz ending is bad or insensible.
Lord Shiva have raisen again but this time not with the swords , but with the powerful moral and ethics. If you are expecting Lord Shiva to fight like a hunk (as he did in The immortals of Meluha and Secret of Nagas) you will be disappointed. The majour war scenes are owned by Karthik and Ganesh. Amish's previous two books had promised an epic ending but he failed to deliver it. Yet the novel is worth reading because of its narration style and gripping plot.
The book is much different from its predecessors in terms of action.Its fast-paced,thrilling and satisfying piece of literature.The author has tastefully depicted war scenes starting with the opening moves till the end.It is a fitting end to the popular historical fiction,which is constructed entirely on logic and reasoning. So i recommend this book to all book lovers coz its a priceless treat that you cant miss.
Very well written final book of the triology... Mythological events known to us have been well adapted in the storyline and are described in great detail. A fresh point of view to see the mythological characters.... Great book.
I just awaited the arrival of this eagerly, which can only be compared with that of a young kid waiting for his beloved comics. I read the first 2 books of the sequel and I should say I am not disappointed. The book takes you through the journey of the life of Shiva described not as a divine creature or mythological being, but as one elevated to that pedestal by virtue of his sheer character and will to do right the wrong against odds
First of all, I could not understand why the book named oath of the Vayuputras? They really didn't played any important role. After reading first two book I had started thinking that Shiva will really do something extraordinary but he could not. Rather he just driven by emotions and could not became leader. Rather I would say that Shati and Kartik emerged as better leader. It is not possible to worship some one who destroy whole city just because two or three of them conspired and killed his wife. Certainly not as mahadev. Also the book is very slow and have unnecessary detailed about lots of things. The first two book were exceptionally good but last one ruined all of them. :(
Part 3 of the Shiva Trilogy is a big book (longer than the first two put together, if I am not mistaken) but the pace does not slacken, making it an easy read. It takes great imagination to put together something like this - kudos to the author for the effort. The Oath of the Vayuputras however is the weakest of the three books, primarily due to a weak finish. The climax was underwhelming after a great build up in the first two books as well as the first half of this one. It almost felt as if the author was rushed to bring it all to a close. Nevertheless, it is a decent read and only pales given the high expectations. Taken together, the three books would easily rank among the best efforts by Indian authors in recent years.
The final book of the Shiva trilogy has managed to live up to the expectations and the hype that it's release had created. Though the book is very slow paced, it manages to capture the reader's attention by a riveting end. Amish has provided a very interesting dimension to the tales of Gods that people often dismiss as mere myths. As with the previous books, someone who is familiar with the Hindu mythology will be able to appreciate the way the characters have been etched. The book does justice to each and every character they had introduced before. Don't hesitate to include it in your collections.
I think Amish Tripathi was in a hurry to finish his trilogy. The Secret of the Nagas & The Immortals of Meluha were both captivating, "hard to put down" books, which made you interested, awed & moved you all at the same time. The Oath of the Vayuputras, however, despite its ambitious title and glorified introductions fails misribly to build on the foundation placed by the first two books. The plot is unconvincing, the narration is long winded, and Tripathi's Shiva swings between exasperating and annoyingly emotion driven. The scenes of war are numerous and almost unecessarily detailed. After reading the first and second helpings of this trilogy, one would begin to picture Shiva as more than the emotional barometer he potrays in part 3. After all, Shiva WAS more than charismatic dancer and skillful warrior - an able commander, an admirable leader, someone who could see the "big picture". Yet this man - who was able enough to turn God - is willing to level an entire city, with hoardes of innocents in it over mad rage when his wife dies an honorable soldier's death? Not to mention; men are innocent too, not just women & children. Sati tries to live up to her admirable character, and mythologically or "Amish -fantasy" cally, I doubt she would have chosen another way to die had she been asked. At the end of this book, the reader's admiration has waned to sort of sympathy for Shiva's loss is all. Definitely a let down after the first two, I'd recommend a no buy - no read. Five stars for Flipkart's exceptional service! I had the book on the very day it released thanks to my preorder! Thank you!!
I had read The secret of the nagas in one night flat, in the process utterly wasting the next day; and when I picked up Vayuputras, I was frightened the same would be repeated. But alas!, that was not be. 1st things 1st, what really was the point of the title if the vayuputras had all but 5 pages in the book?? Their oath came towards the last 100 pages of the book yet we named the entire book based on that?? The title seems least befitting. ****Spoiler ahead***** Having gotten the above out of the way, lets start with the day I got the book. I started reading it with much fervour and enthusiasm, but a couple of days (and only a minuscule number of hours in), I lost all interest. The book seemed to perplex me more than entice me. The scenes of the book were too laborious to be imagined. It seemed the sole purpose of Amish in this book was to extend the geography of the story rather than actually concentrating on what is IN the story. The characters (except for Kartik and Sati) were only shades of themselves. None jumped out the book to be able to take you by awe. Who was Tara and what role she had to play in the whole plot was unfathomable. How did Vidyunmali escape from his captors, and how did he get his hands on a Vasudev soldier was again inexplicable? Why was Bhrugu suddenly repentant in the end? Because Sati was killed? Couldn't she have been killed in the war he was foraging? What then? If he were to repent, why wage the war in the 1st place? Way too many loose ends. By the end of it, I was just reading it as I HAD to complete the book and thus the trilogy, certainly not the best reason to be reading a book! But there were 3 strong reason why this book left me less than satisfied: 1) The book takes way too long to pick pace. The initial 300 pages or so (most books are about that long) are mostly about the landscapes and the "planning". Nothing interesting in the story really. 2) Not a single turn or twist in the plot. Frankly, after having read Nagas, I expected there to be some sort of twists and turns in the plot but for the straightforward story line! (I was hoping for a twist and turn till the final 5 pages of book, at which point I finally convinced myself that there would be none). 3) The "apparent climax" ( I call it so as it was not befitting the climax of a TRILOGY). What could have been epic turned out to be a mere whimper! The following are some of the reasons why: a) Sati's Death: Felt no emotions whatsoever. Whether her death was really necessary to the the plot or not is a debate in itself. But even keeping that aside, Shiva emotions were too lightly portrayed. Yes, he did feel the pain, but somewhere the author missed in harnessing the same feeling among the readers. Found it hard to relate to Shiva and his emotions. b) Why was Devagiri, the city of gods destroyed for the apparent foolhardiness of 2 men?! Does people paying for the sins committed by their leaders seem fair? If today our PM were to make a grave mistake in the diplomatic relations, would it be fair to bomb the whole of India? LUDICROUS! I would have respected Shiva much more had he looked beyond his rage and not made a decision under that influence. Would have truly bowed to him had he looked at the greater good of mankind than factor in his emotions alone. Killing innocents can never draw respect, whatever may be the reason. Kartik on the other hand was thinking reasonably, which is what Shiva should have resorted to. c) The rush towards the end of the book was evident. Had the author suddenly realised that he had stretched the story too far and it is now time to wrap up quickly? Sati's end (and the ensuing emotions) and Devagiri's destruction were the only dramatic incidents of the story, both portrayed with lack of sheen, grandeur or feelings. I was happy that we finally have a home grown, settled in India literary genius, but this book makes me think Amish still has some way to go. May be next time.
Amish introduced the mystical world of mythology to us in an enchanting manner, giving a much-awaited Lord of the Rings series of our own. While the first one was a riveting beginning, the second one was a class apart, leaving the readers salivating for a notch higher. But as it happened with The Dark Knight, the third installment just couldn't surpass this almighty height. Its not a reflection on the part of the 3rd book, its just that the author had set the bar so high that it was somewhat of a let-down. The Oath of the Vayuputras picks up from where we had left, and Shiva ultimately discovers the true Evil which is surprisingly plausible. All now remains is to eradicate this evil and chart a new path for India. While the plot promised a greater intensity and drama, I guess Amish tried too many things in the same book, making it a bit cumbersome in stages-its a 600-page long account and to sustain the intensity is a big challenge for any author. While Amish continues that incredible mix of facts and fiction, this time he also tries his best to answer some of the ever complex questions, which sometimes becomes preachy. It doesn't help when the account starts becoming predictable too. One thing which Amish has nailed is the depiction of his characters. With each one being passionate about their 'karma' and 'dharma'-Sati comes as a revelation in this book- Parvateshwar rules the roost, slightly a notch below the 'one'- Shiva. While Amish has used every possible adjective to describe the Mahadev, one sudden thought that comes into one's mind while reading the series is- Shiva is the ultimate 'DUDE'! Hoping Amish keeps mesmerizing us with such masterpieces, it would be really one hell of an experience to read his version of the greatest story of India, in case he ever decides to pen it down. 'Har Har Mahadev!'
The idologies that Shiva held including his great love of Sati prooved that he was a God in the form of a human. But his reaction towards the end and his complete going away from what Sati stood for left me completely dissatisfied. I read each page expecting Shiva to redeem himself. A Neelkanth whose very birth was predecided... should have made him in debt to all - the world at large and the Vayuputras. To his uncle who went through so much pain to inculcate so much worthy of a leader of the future. The end left me with a feeling of void inside.
Dear Readers I really waited for the third part to come. But now after finishing this book, I am really disappointed to say the least. It looked like this third book has just painted a passport size photo in news paper size canvas prepared by the second book (Secret of Nagas). I felt that Anish is writing a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. But finally it is one of those read and forget type of books that have flooded the bookshelves. I tender my sincere apologies to those who are hurt by my remarks. As for Flipkart...five stars for speedy and quality service.
Could not imagine that a fabulous story can have such a disappointing end to it. This book is way too detailed to engage the reader. Moreover, if we compare the previous two books, it does not measure up to the standards. But one can read it if you have time. For Flipkart, I feel its the best website for books. Their service is outstanding. Kudoos to Flipkart.
The third book in the trilogy could not live up to the expectations created by the first two books. Firstly, the title of this book was not apt as Vayuputras were hardly there in the book. A lot of sub plots were thrown in the book which take you away from the narrative and eventually you end up feeling that there was very less of Shiva in this book. Moreover, the Shiva you read about in this book is very different from the one we have read about in the first two installments. And the most disappointing aspect of the book is the end. It just didn't do justice to the character of Shiva. Where one ends up thinking of Shiva as God of Gods in the first two books, this book somewhat takes away that greatness from him...
I think its the worst of the three. There are few live action sequences and hopelessly long arguments and brainstorming sessions. Sati is the only credible character in the entire book. The ending seems like somebody is trying to finish his/her exam papers after the final bell. Not impressed at all.
Its a mythological tale having all the Gods as Humans. 3rd part starts with an interesting turn of events. Honestly true evil was not easy to predict. Though it gets a little boring in the middle due to extensive explanation of the surrounding but still it doesn't let the reader loose interest. Last chapter is a must read. How normal persons were converted into God.
Full points to Amish to have conceived such kind of a story and put up in words in such a wonderful fashion. The philosophy conveyed is told perfectly and in the simplest words. The plot has 'at least' 10 important characters almost always involved in a scene, but they are handled pretty efficiently. Not for once the reader gets confused with the characters. With the high expectations that the first two parts of the trilogy had set, the third part kicks off absolutely to the mark. Amish has tried to rationalize things that we hold as myths today, quite convincingly. With everything spoken of so scientifically in the story, in the middle of the third part however, the reader tends to feel there are a few lose ends to the story. Some things that seem so obvious to the reader, but not considered by the author in the story. Nevertheless, the story quite binds the reader with a lot of enthu. However, the last 3-4 chapters are where the story loses it all COMPLETELY. A lot of readers will agree that the end is quite unexpectedly boring and sad. An adventure and all the promises that the three books had set come to such a pathetic end, the reader is left unsatisfied. Why he chose such an end to such a wonderful story is a thing to ponder. Its still worth a read though. After all, the trilogy by the million-dollar author is the most talked about book in a long time now. Go for it. But dont expect a satisfactory end !!
Anybody who has read "Meluha" and "The Nagas" would surely not miss "The Vayuputras". One does tend to compare this one with the other two to find that it is slow and unnecessarily descriptive. You do not get that engrossed as in the other two books as the plot is loose and all the strings are not woven together properly. However, it is a unique blend of mythology and fiction with such reasonable scientific explanations that one tend to wonder where the truth lies- in what we choose to believe or what should be believed. The research is surely comprehensive. All credits to Amish for such a bold attempt.
When reading a book it always stays as a book in my mind, but when reading this book Amish takes the story in the Shiva Trilogy, like I still can't believe i'm actually reading a book. It always feels like i'm watching a feature film. A film only which my mind can see. The Shiva Trilogy is one of my first books. The only drawback is that it is not in Tamil. It would be better if this book was in Tamil. There are many people who will really buy this book if it was in Tamil. Not only Tamil, but also many other languages in which it can be translated. The book is very good. "HAR HAR MAHADEV".
I loved the books, within 3 days I finished 20 chapters while working on my stupid projects. Although loosing a little interest now. Not as intriguing as the previous two books. But one thing for sure that we finally got our Superhero much realistic and possible. I believe that although it is a fiction. But it is good read to realize that each man can grow to become god by prevailing with goodness inside him. Loved the concept and plots, characterization.
Adopt few things not in fiction life but in real. Thumps up!!! Skill of writing is extraordinary to its core. Contemplating to do the same if Shiva gives an opportunity for me too :). Hope to see good works from Amish. Thanks!
Needless to doubt . . This is a true conclusion t the legend of Mahadev . . This may be a conceptual realization. But desreves blind and vast appreciation and acceptance . That lies not just with my incapable words, Within my heart. Forever !! Amish was being loyal to shiva through out his journey, and he is still travelling through reader's mind . . In my personal opinion, with this third part Amish was burning my devotion to Lord Shiva and making me passionate about him . . .A blinfd devotee of lord Shiva !!!! SHIVA STANDING ON THE SHORES OF MANASAROVAR . . BEHIND HIM THE GREAT MOUNT KAILASH . . "THAT EVENING WITH THE SHADOW OF EMPTINESS . . THE CHILLY WIND BLOWN OVER THERE. . WHAT I SEE IN HIS EYES !!!!" that picture is gonna remain with me until I CEASE TO BREATHE . i was not explaining about book . . because am sure u r gonna read it for sure, and u will be getting a much more fruitful experience . . Go for it !! Dont think twice
I am not a voracious reader, infact this is the first novel that I have read in recent years. A friend of mine gave me the 3 books and finished all the 3 in about a week. Compared to the first 2, the last one indeed is a bit lengthy and the great war wasn't as interesting as the previous ones. What I liked overall is the different take / interpretation of Shiva, communism, capitalism, romance, medicine and side effects etc. It is a mish mash of everything you see in everyday world, and the author has attempted to weave a thread around heavy subjects, albeit with little success. All the 3 books, if read back to back, is a page turner. Though a lot of my friends who waited for the 3rd book for more than a year feels that it is a let down. I didn't feel too disappointed since I didn't have to wait in suspense for the 3rd book.
Unlike the first two installments of the Shiva Trilogy this one is a bit longer and gets a bit dragging in the middle. The beginning is very good unleashing the secret behind Brahsapathi's return and his hiding for so long. The buildup for the great war felt a bit dragging and the climax was also a bit of slowdown , as i expected a much extravagant end to this one. However like the first two installments Amish keeps up his excellent comprehension skills with in depth details of every thing.
The title has nothing to do with the story - Vayuputras just have a guest appearance and why would people in Persia be concerned whether the people in India kill themselves by war or whatever? The plot in the last book seemed to be going round in circles and the objective being to get the book over and done with.
Oath of the Vayaputras (Part 3 of the Shiva trilogy) offers such a depressing and underwhelming end to a promising story! I felt the end of this book was hastily written, possibly under pressure. Amish built a solid plot in the first two novels. It was let go, at the end, here!
Its probably no surprise that anyone who has read the Immortals of Meluha would have pre-ordered both the secret of the Nagas and The oath of the vayupturas. As usual Flipkart was super prompt in their delivery. But the book itself was a big letdown. Yes his writing has definitely become more bearable compared to the first book but the plot is all over and the writing still has a lot left to be desired. This book was a must read for me as a Shiva lover but it was certainly a big let down for i think somewhere deep down i was hoping the author would have somehow magically improved his writing skills.
This novel has made my mind on making second decisions that there are capable authors left in India who can amaze the whole world. The plot is great and is a must read. The real deal is the final twist in Shiva's plan and life. That is............. OH!!!!!! I can't tell you. But I assure you, the final twist will leave you dumbstruck.
The book has enough pace to keep you hooked. Also the story is interesting though predictable. Many review's say that the trilogy has not ended on an interesting note but it is not so.....the author has left much to our own imagination...The author portrays Shiva as the most powerful and influential character the world has ever seen. But at the end you feel that he is a creation of the ultimate destiny......it is as if he was born only by the will of destiny....destiny already had it that he will be a unquestionable leader.Only then the divine fire in him ignited to such limits that it became the ultimate destroyer of evil......,for a mere mortal can never posses such humility that will rise him to be lovable leader and anger that time can never cool at the same time.....finally it is not HAR HAR MAHADEV, SHIVA THE ONLY MAHADEV!!!!!
it could have been an epic conclusion to the great Shiva Trilogy..ultimately became an average book with some pondering characters and blood everywhere...there is a lot of unanswered questions left by Amish..the editing is not good..More than one chapters could be omitted from the book.. The equation of the evil is good..But the most confusing was the title..The Oath of the Vauputras..it was so boring at times that i keep forgetting the names of the characters..Amish..If you are going to write The Mahabharata..this time try to focus on the core storyline and keep ur best shot for the last shot..We expect a lot from you.. ABSOLUTELY DISSAPOINTING ..Though ignites the sparks in few chapters.. Har Har Mahadev!!
Buy this book and read this through, so that you will not be taken for a ride by Mr. Amish next time. Was the ending of this part narrated by Karan Johar and Mr. Amish just put it in writing. If you have any respect for the previous two books, read this and all respect will go away. Why can't Indian authors just write for writing's sake, why do they need to write their novel for some dumb producer or director. This book is nothing but a melodramatic script for a typical Karan Johar movie. Period.
Personally I feel this book could have had a better ending than what actually happens in mythology. But Amish has cleverly blended the elements in the same way. I was bit disappointed when I was expecting a more happy ending like a typical Bollywood story but this book was unique in its own way . A good read not an excellent though
Not best of Amish.. Simply i can say is, this book is not up to the expectation... may be due the fact that this book does not deal with any secrets... starting is slow.. in the mid way it get some momentum.. but in the end.. it gets flat.. Waiting for Amish next books..
No.. No.. Amish, tell me that you didn't take the amazing build up of the first two books and squander it away thus. I am half way through and am so unimpressed and bored. Vasudev's turning elephants into flame-throwing tanks, Kartik turning into some kind of blood thirsty Taliban against people of Magadha and worst of all, Lord Shiva himself become party to killing of innocents ... man, you must have been really out of ideas. The first two books were good. This is plain isn't. The plot meanders around and like the great Sarawati river, looses itself somewhere. The key message - that all good becomes evil after sometime may have some validity but it isn't enough to hold the book together.. Try again please.
After reading the first and second books of the Shiva Trilogy you kind of get the hang of it . But the last book isnt really stand upto the mark. Amish had set standards high for himself. The last part of story has many up and downs . The story becomes boring at some times. This was not what I expected from Amish
The book is good in patches. Too much detailing makes it boring sometimes. The ending was the most disappointing of all. Given the success of the first two books and the subsequent hype created for the third one, hopes were high n one could say it was a bit disappointing! Nevertheless a good book, overall.
As usual there's nothing to comment about Flipkart,because it's the best as every time. Got book in my hands on the release date. Amazing. The Story and the plot were extremely good as the previous ones in the trilogy. Amish did a very very amusing job in portraying the story and the journey. Thumbs up to Amish and congrats. He's the great Indian English author after many decades. Many people reviewed that this book is bit boring, but it's not at all boring, rather it is too interesting and philosophical at the grounds. Every character conveys some message which is actually told by our mythology. The concepts which were told in Indian myth are really brought to their truth. He really reached the actual meaning by the story. The story has sentimental, philosophical, mythological truth, fictional and dramatic mixture which makes it the best book and Amish the best author though. P.S. Bollywood! Please don't ruin the best ever novel India has seen after many years by trying film it. it's an humble request.
I really don't like Amish been called 'Dan Brown' or 'Paulo Coelho' of the East. He has gone his own way. He has really shown how an eastern story should proceed and end. How in eastern philosophy, war means total destruction, how good is even scarred beyond repair after the destruction of evil, how there is a price to be paid at the end, is all shown in his writing. However, his language seems too modern for the times he writes about. That may be the only negative point about his novels. Overall, he does a brilliant job converting the fantastical legends in the Puranas into real world factual events as they may have been, though in some places the connection may have been stretched to breaking point (avoiding spoilers, otherwise I would have explained the part of the book)! Thank you, Amish and Good Luck with your next book on our greatest epic (Again avoiding spoilers).
the book was good throughout (not the coclusion)...the plot was good.....contains vivid description .....bt some questions still remains unanswered...and the end is sudden as if the author had to finish it within a few more pages and thus the end came suddenly ... and it brings a question on the very purpose of Lord Neelkanth...he should have taken evil out of equation without harming good ....bt killing of parvateshwar and other Meluhans was not at all acceptable.....and he broke his promise to the vayuputras which should have been avoided...... the vayuputras don't have a major role to play in the whole book so the title is a bit misleading.....bt overall the book's storyline and plot was good( except the finish).... i'll give it 4/5
As i said well written but could have been superb writing by Amish, The trilogy ends with Good V/s Evil. Wonderful mythological fiction , when the end nears, feels like it should go on, the characters are also well written, a fiction of hindu mythology at this level and reaching to such an extent, truly Amish is going to be one of the writers who will be remembered in history of Indian writers fiction category. The third book is with many twists and surprises. Others can read and please don't go by the reviews of the other readers. Har Har Mahadev..
Amish gave us a great series and a brilliant concept, but he seems to have lost the plot towards the end of part three of this trilogy. The book fails to delineate clearly the role of Shiva in the fight against evil. The character development of Karthikeya is rather abrupt and leaves no lasting impression. The book seems to be entirely about Sati. Her character is etched out beautifully and the final chapter on her brings tears to one's eyes. Towards the end Amish seems to be unable to figure out what is to be done with his characters.His need to tie up loose strings is so urgent that it leaves the reader ungratified.
A good start in this 3rd part with lots of aggression expected but An unexpected climax with lots of small wars in between...if you love mythology and wars ...shiva trilogy will be the one ...overall a good sequel by amish..Now i became a die hard fan of SHIVA....
after reading the Immortals of Meluha and the secrets of nagas , I bought it, and its worth to read .love the way amish ji narrate the story .The printing and publishing of the book is of the top notch quality!
well people who are aware about the legend of mahadev won't find it anyway disappointing because if this book is to relate "it's the story of a man whom legend turned into a god" then i don't thing anymore supernatural changes would have made it any better to make it look so realistic. and about the story, it was heartbreaking for me. well i knew it even we all know that lady sati had to die. but he would bring such a beautiful yet devastatingly heartbreaking end was something i did not expect would sound so logical. now in
With great expectations I preordered this book only to find that it doesn't match upto the hype. The climax is a total letdown and the book is boring in parts. The magic of the previous books is clearly missing !
The sheer magic of suspense, the intricate twisting of mythology into subplots which defined the awesomeness of Immortals of Meluha and Secret of Nagas is completely missing here. The Oath of Vayuputras was too predictable. Sure the trailing off and potential leads to another trilogy based on Mahabharata is intriguing but the book per se has failed to reach up to the expectations.
If not compared with the books which has been followed by this, then it is a really nice work by Amish. But after the author has captured millions of readers' mind with his awesome work in his first two ventures..this one doesn't live upto the expectations. The book is a tad too long, although one might feel the need to explain certain things. The climax was below par considering the anticipation built around the trilogy. It is a must read for someone who has read the previous two..for others do start from 'The immortals of meluha', you would love it!!
Entire story of all 3 books is after Krishna Avatar. It is good book flowing story always few surprises at every page. The 3rd book delivers philosophic message in very simple way, you can relate that to your life. The most important part of Any Story is end part, how it ends? This has very sad and very brief glimpse of main character's life and relatives, after he destroys what he must do as Neelkanth? In my opinion, even Neel-kanth is failed as successor of Rudra..as he didn't destroys(i mean not exactly made it Perish but ) the evil without burning the good along with it. About the end of this book writer must had felt that "Now i got bored of writing this book and i want to end it within next 10 pages" It abrupty ends so i will cut some marks but overall it is good not the best.. if you have chance of reading this from library pls grab the copy read and thn decide if u want it to keep it for ur collection.
Not as good as compared to previous 2 parts.It comprises of lot of journeys undertaken and a few fights but it lacks the thrills.Also the ending is not as good as was expected.You may feel that the author has unnecessarily elongated the story.I would rate it a three by looking at the different thought given by the author to mythology and based on the trilogy as a whole.
The most awaited book - The Oath of Vayuputras, is very disappointing. First two books make you spellbound but the last part will not make the journey so adventurous... Author dragged the story to 600 pages which can be written in 300 pages..Its all about the war and there are absolutely no twists that make you crazy. I didn't find this book that interesting. Climax is average and lacks the thrill which is not expecting from Amish after the stupendous narration of first two books.
i have completed this book in one day, as i simply cant put the book down, even though i want to save some pages so i could spend some time for next day, but any how i left nothing for the next day. by finishing all the 3 books, with that climax i understand his intention and felt that he made the story real. he could have given the book a happy ending, a god who made no mistake, but by end amish explained that he is also a human, but a great one. i totally liked the book. may be i missed some where, so please enlighten me what happened to the army which parvatheswara rao and brighu maharshi left at karachappa left the place but never mentioned whether it reached devagiri or not. the language is simple, a loving mother sati who really made me miss my mother, immediately left for my home.
Most of my friends who read this book felt that the ending could have been better. More brighter and all is well that ends well sort of ending. But then again I accept it is hard to digest that your hero would make a mistake. I am not speaking of Amish but about Shiva. Amish is such a wonderful writer and he has created a masterpiece. It is almost that everyone who has read his book have fallen in love with the simple yet elegant style in which he narrates and goes about giving details of the story in such a great and captivating flow. It is because of this that everyone who read the 1st and 2nd book fell in love with the main protagonist SHIVA. It is that style of Amish in which he makes Shiva the tribesmen to Shiva-the great LORD, the Neelakantha that makes it hard for us in the end to accept that he would make a mistake and that he would regret his action. But then again Mahadeva is a person who is not GOD by virtue but GOD by deed. This is what Amish has tried to portray in his book. And he has done a commendable job. Wonderful job Amish Sir. We love you.
Amish still holds the reader with his simple yet convincing language. The story starts of slowly from where it left behind. A little drag at the beginning may not impress every one. The story kicks off pace around 20th chapter and hold you glued till the last. There is lot of violence attached to Karthik in his briefing which was not required. As a Indian reader, you may feel the story unwinds its secrecy very early as to what is the real evil and later is a drag. However you may have to appreciate that he connects the middle east mythology and Lama's very well till the end. The twist is all in these episodes. The love between Shiva and Sati is beautifully told. Parvateshwar character stands out to be no less to Neelkanth at the end. Overall its a very nice book which would not bore you if you admired the Neelkanth , the warrior from the far land of Tibet . Om Namah Shivaya!!
The plot is okay but not awesome. The first 2 parts of Shiva Triology is very exiting and gripping compared to the last one OATH OF VAYUPUTRAS. the climax part 3 is a big let down. I'd expected some aweinspiring plot to the end but it doesn't have any. But still Kudos to the author for his effort and wonderful work. The only thing that got my full attention is THE FINAL KILL and after that the author killed my excitement. A big let down expected more considering the first 2 but the final one is dumb. Flipkart rocks once again in getting this done as promised. Thanks Team Flipkart for wonderful service.
Had been waiting for the book for quite sometime and sadly was extremely disappointed with it. Perhaps because I kept on comparing Shiva to a God and this time Shiva came across as a total chauvinistic man.. I finished this book only because I dont like leaving books half unread. The delivery was on time. and the book was in a fine condition. Two half hearted stars from me.
Two worlds collide....War is at hand.....Which side you choose?....... The book is an excellent reflection of the atrocities of the modern generation set in an era that invokes every readers' curiosity.The book,a perfect conclusion to the Shiva Trilogy, does not change the actual legend a lot but Amish's genius is able to raise powerful questions like,is the destruction of evil the prime task of any society or the birth of a greater good?,whose answers can be significant in the contemporary world. The plot opens more loopholes than the first or second book, comes to a full circle in the final chapters. Every character in the story blooms towards the end and make it difficult for the reader to stop after a few pages. Finally the story's gravity and the mystery behind Shiva "The Mahadev's" fate is bound to appeal the mind's eye of every reader.
The book had a promising start but the author just got lost mid way. The descriptions of forts/ports/palaces/cities were too long and completely unnecessary. The conclusion was so lame! as if the author ran out of ideas and suddenly ended the book. After reading the previous 2 books I had very high expectations, which came down crashing with this book. A complete waste of Rs 245!
I am seeing many reviewers making a lot of noise about the length of the book, weak plot especially in the third part, every minute of detail blah blah blah... Here I feel most of them get biased since all of them have read/ watched some kind of Shiva story in their lives and it is actually impossible to still write it in a form which gives you surprises, goosebumps and shock on every page. In that regard, Amish has done the greatest job. Truly a masterpiece. I have never read so many pages at such a pace, with so much of passion and intensity. Let me tell you, westland did a 5 crore deal with Amish for his next series. Mammoth for any Indian author and when you count the rights for all over world and movie as well, he has already earned 20 crores. Nobody is fool to make him the sensation of Indian Literature.
As usual good service from Flipkart.com. Unexpected ending. Filled with morals and values Second half makes u turn the pages. Explanation of the surroundings to the minute makes u yarn. Overall book is ok , could have been lot better .
Quite a big book, 600 pages long....for the first 400 pages, the plot of the story bores us with its draggy narration and unnecessary elements but picks up pace later on. Comparing the first two books, this one's a damp squib in this trilogy. The author could have shortened the book to make it a better read by eliminating all the unnecessary investigation in the identification of evil. Not worth the hype it created. I hope Amish's next would bring a change in us to forget this satisfactory work of his. But just for the interesting climax, 2 stars from me.
Very Good... Excellent narration.. The way of Rama's life style was narrated with suspense and dramatic scenes . Thanks to Amish for giving us such great books. I have read the other 2 books too. Amazing.
Literally, i have came up with the worst book of my life. Such a painful reading "Oath of Vayuputras". In the name of fiction when author goes for simple publicity stunt the product is this kind of book. The first one of the trilogy was still readable. But this third one is the limit. Don't know how people tolerates this nuisance. Never regretted wasting money for a book before.
Amish has taken us on a beautiful visual journey with the Siva Trilogy and the third and last book of the series was brilliantly cenceptualized and powerfully written. The author's protrayal of our loved Gods Ganesh, Karthik, Siva and Sati is simply awesome. Love the depth of each and every character, loved the intelligence behind every war strategy and loved the fact that the words weaved amazing visuals of ancient India.
Half way through the book the plot turned boring, the story a bit confusing.. not the end that one would expect. The first 2 books were awesome, this is a let down. I even went ahead and pre ordered the book hoping that it will be an awesome finish. But the plot died down in the end, i just had to go through the pages, lost interest 50 pages from the end!
The first two parts were very well written and so I was looking forward to read an excellent conclusion to the story in the third part. Unfortunately, Amish misses the mark here. In the end Shiva did what any commoner would do if he were handed a power so great. What distinguishes Shiva from a common man? Whereâ€™s his evolution from man to God? All through the novel virtues of fighting fair are elaborated to set example and in the end the Lord himself does something thatâ€™s a gross misconduct. His family goes on to torture one of the prisoners of war and wipe out whole tribe to punish for someoneâ€™s misdeed. Also, the attack in final sequence punishes so many innocent that their generations can hardly revere Shiva as God. The other side drops their weapons for the simple reason of an unethical attack but the wars fought are not always fair, are they? Parvateshwar, who was so dedicated to his country surrenders for no solid reason. And the master mind of the other side, who initially ordered an attack without notice, recognizes the final murder as unethical but not his earlier acts. Somethingâ€™s amiss. To conclude this novel doesnâ€™t give the feeling of end of the story of a man becoming God
Part 1 was good, Part 2 was better, part 3 .. well not so good! May be I had set huge expectations to the magical build up in Part 2, the storyline becomes way to predictable. But still worth reading it..
The virtual life story of Lord Shiva is very well imagined by AMISH and expressed in a very nice manner.. once you start reading you don't feel to do anything expect reading the book. its an awesome book. And also the Best Series released in INDIA. . :) Must Read. . :)
Amish is a fabulous story teller. Every scene brilliantly written. Won't talk much about the story as it may reveal the secrets. But yes, you will surely love the final part if you enjoyed the first 2 parts. I didn't expected the end to be the way it was, but it is justifiable. Too much detailed description sometimes make you feel to skip it and directly jump to the action part. The secrets revealed hold some logic and are not introduced just for the sake of making it a thriller.
"The oath of Vayuputras" is the last book of the Shiva Trilogy by Amish. This also turn out to be another great book like it's previous two versions i.e. 'The Immortals of Meluha' & 'The Secret Of The Nagas'. Although some part of this books seems quite slow and more descriptive than usual eventful-flow. But overall this is simply a great book full of mystery, adventure and thrill. So, in one word this is a mast read book for all bookworm like me. This particular package is a wonderful offer provided by Flipkart. As always kudos to the Flipkart delivery system.
Cheers for fast delivery, i was somehow controlling my horses for this final part and what added to delight is the Quick Response Time of flipkart team.Amish has illustrated the whole Journey in a gigantic view with noble narration.It was the most awaited part and finally the story ends.Well one will definitely miss the War and the tactics that were in Second part but on moral grounds this part is up.what i was expecting a massive and a large scale war but if you go with the theme and crux of the whole phenomenon then this expectation is ruled out.Story definitely build up like that and one can expect a Mahabharat kind of scenario but i loved the way the whole story turned in the last few chapters.I am ardent follower of SHIVA and i loved the way Amish imagined Shiva. People go ahead and finish it up.
Hai Thanks to FlipKart for Good on time Delivery of my First Book which i ever purchased. and i had just started reading the book from today, only 1st chapter i had read, its nice to read about my God Shiva
a fast paced ...accelerating and coming out from my soul..... its amazing even in after just reading first 10 pages, every sentence is thrilling and swirling world of imagination toed to the spritual faiths..... wow ...It was not like reading a book but watching it really infront of your subconscious eyes .....HAR HAR MAHADEV..... ...AMISH...I WANT TO MEET YOU...PLZ
First of all, Flipkart as usual was great. I got the delivery of the book I pre-ordered on the day of it's launch 27-Feb-2013. This was for my wife who loves reading. I am not a voracious reader. But, I did read the first two books (at a very slow pace :) which is usually my pace of reading) of Shiva trilogy and liked the concept by Amish. My wife finished the book in a day. She liked it. She had guessed who the evil was even before the book had come out and guess what? She was right. I started reading the book after my wife went through the book a couple of more times. I finished a few chapters and then my wife's cousin borrowed it from us. I understood the plot and I must say Amish missed a trick or two. The suspense could have been suspense until the end of the book. But it was revealed in the beginning and everything else then becomes boring. Still, worth a read. Kudos to Amish for coming up with this FANTASTIC concept.
One of the much awaited books is finally read and enjoyed. Amish has done a great job is writing this 3rd book of Shiva Trilogy, though it seems lengthy, justified keeping in mind the plot and all the blanks to be covered from the previous 2 Books. Well done Amish!
I found the end of this series rather abrupt. The first two parts were quite interesting and had a very good build-up to the final book. However, even though this book had a good beginning, the finish just felt flat on its face. It seemed that the book finished just for the sake of it. However, it'll surprisingly be a good book for Structural Engineers/Architects with a lot of details given to the way cities have been built by the various groups of characters of this story...
It's ok when compared to the previous 2 books. i don't know if it's me who lost it midway or it's genuinely slow paced compared to the previous books. I mean I didnt want to put the other books down after i started reading them. This is not that good I feel. Anyways, it's good to read and complete the trilogy:)
Of the shiva's trilogy the first two installments were interesting and intriguing. The initial flow of the third installment is equally engrossing but it lets you down in the middle and tail of the final plot as it is made unnecesasarily dramatic and emotional. The author has tried to justify/ reason the present belief about the characters through some imaginary fictional acts which is completely unwarrranted.
Was really expecting more from Amish this time. They got us hooked with two great books and ended it with an average book with the same "India had nuclear weapons drama". I mean seriously, can we please not beat the same drum (Cough-- The Krishna key--). I mean we all saw the Ancient Aliens series on The History Channel.
a nice end to the shiva trilogy. though my heart cried for maa sati as she was not there to be with the lord. splendid , awesome. and thanks , many many thanks to amish. thanks a lot for writing this wonderfull trilogy which would remain in my mind and soul for many days.
GREAT BOOK..LOVED THE WAY AMISH PORTRAYED THE WAR SCENES..........HAD TEARS IN MY EYES WHILE READING FINAL FEW CHAPTERS.............!! FEW OF MY QUESTIONS LEFT UNANSWERED THOUGH LIKE NO MENTION OF PARWATI JI etc
The Shiva Trilogy without any doubt is a brilliant work. In 'The Oath of the Vayuputras' one will find some parts very disappointing. What i missed /didnt like in the book was: 1. The freedom taken to imagine nuclear weapons with description of fission and fusion, binary states of electric signals in brain etc.. That they had very powerful weapons or mind reading abilities would have been fine but why describe fission and fusion, binary states etc. 2. 'The Oath of the Vayuputras' leaves you guessing where is the Oath inside the book. The title is not apt for the content of the story inside. Even if it is about the Shiva being one of their Tribe but hidden from all...its not central enough to be the title. 3. The story holds you in the later half and you expect the ending to be very different from what you would find with a sudden end. In the whole story, you wonder, where was the greatness of Shiva? Sati becomes the center of attention in the later half.
Might be the expectations were very high post the first two installments on the Shiva trilogy. Oath Of Vayputra does not charm with the same intensity and continues to be a modest approach . But You would still like to read it once if you were all tuned to the rhythm it had started with Immortals. Book is less of Shiva, but more of Sati's adventures, the nasty diplomatic traps . Sati's character has come up as more dignified. Har Har Mahadev continues to be the driving mantra .
About the service: Received the book in good packaging, as all ways. Flipkart team is appreciable for this effort however, the package was not delivered on time and only after calling up the customer service team, i got to know that the package was wrongly sent to another location in mumbai. from there it took another two days to get it back and sent to my actual address. This is one important aspect of customer service, that I would recommend the flipkart team to look into. They should proactively inform the client, if there has been any unprecedented delay in shipping or delivering the purchased product. Customers would like to have a call from the customer service to inform them that there has been some dealy. They have updated the status of the package on the website but a simple phone call would give them an edge and create a good rapport with the clients and thus increasing the satisfaction rating. besides this i dont have any regrets with flipkart: keep up your good work team. about the book: Nice book and a must read... yes !! however at some point I felt like that the author was out of his usual touch and could have done better to make the story gripping and keep the reader glued to the story. Apart from that this book is a must read and loved reading the book.
I read the first two books of this series in one go. I liked the concept of this series, and the narration style. As like the prequels the last book in the series is also gripping. But the end is not that awesome as one would expect. But still it is enjoyable read. And those who have read the first books would go for it anyway.
the last book of the triology was long awaited..this time i found the narration part is a bit more than the previous books..still the same wonderful experience to read it..the way Amish includes the philosphy of life in the book,attracts me the most..once you start,its hard to stop..ofcourse one should have read the first 2 books in order to enjoy this one
The book is amazing, just like the prequels. Amish Sir's ability to fit in characters and situations to the modern day outlook is much appreciated. This is one of the few rare books which offers an insight into a variety of things hard to comprehend unless speculated upon. Shiva's all engulfing personality is a winner! A book that will stay with you forever! :)
The starting was a bang for the first 70 odd pages, it goes with the pace, mostly reminiscing the previous two books and getting along well with the 'Map of India' and 'Rivers' mainly, without which one cannot enjoy the total book as major strategies were well-digested only with the knowledge of them. The middle-part is my favourite.Exuberant warfare strategies and tactics hooked my adrenaline to much extent. The last quarter is,hmmmm, okay as the justice is what one looks for and serves it. Though you can complain the ending has been bit disappointed, one will finish the book with a satisfying smile. What else an author wants!! e.joy
The first 2 books had me captivated, the finale though kind of left me wanting more. It seemed too filmy and when I shared this view with a friend who is equally avid reader she shared the same sentiments. Came to a point where I was skipping pages just to finish the book. Good series the last book could have been better I guess!
So far So good. Being an ardent Forsyth & Brown fan, I will say Amish still has a long way to go. But his way of writing is encapsulating and engrossing. Kudos to you Mr. Tripathi. I will expect to you continue evolving. You are good. You need to go deeper. The God is in the detail :-D
Flipkart service is awesome as always ! Definite buy this book is for fans of the trilogy/ Indian mythology - but buy it without much of expectation (!!) The author's thoughts are very different and refreshing... Sure the book is archetypal... However, the finishing to a wonderful plot could have been better ! Evil is revealed in the first few pages itself, later there are no major twists or turns until the last few chapters !!! Swuth episode is awesome and touching ! However, not everything is explained satisfactorily in the book as a whole.... Overwhelming start but a damp finish ! Looking forward to more from Amish's thoughts ! Why is this book called "Oath of the vayuputras" ??
Lots of gyaan in this 3rd edition. maybe Amish was preparing the reader for the climax. Immortals of Meluha was simple and interesting, Secret of the Naga's was gripping and left me wanting more... but the Oath of the Vayuputra's was too long and did not come up to a suitable end... many phrases and scenes in the book can be identified with famous movies and catch phrases used in social networking sites... Enjoyed the triology as a whole.
Amish seems to have lost his touch by the third part. After the big bang of "The Immortals of Meluha" and raising his own bar with "Secret of the Nagas" and after a long wait for the end to the trilogy, Amish disappoints with a scattered and messed up end.
Amish really paid a tribute to Mahadev by jotting down a Tale that is equally enthralling as the true mythology we've grown up with. Though the book is enormous content wise but altogether it does justice to the saga that it succeeds. A perfect blend of Mythology and Fiction with a pinch of philosophical intellect ...you won't be able to put it down once proceeded with the first page. Personifying the GOD is not an easy task but Amish did it with pure simplicity and perfection...the Human side of the Lord ,jhis emotions his compassion his perfection even his flaws all are jumbled up to make a great Man as we know the protagonist Shiva...last but not the Least ...I was gloomy while completing this journey as bidding adieu to Shiva was not easy. Caution: - People are not finding this book as interesting as they expected because they need more of adventure and fiction but as I belive Amsih understood the Neelkanth better than many...Shankar is the Lord of ghosts and darkness is associated with him...that will be a part of the story as well...It's not a typical cliche plot ....its actually more than that....plus Sati-daksh is a different story in reality so be prepared to witness that version...! All I hope for is that as hinted in the last lines - we soon come up with the unadulterated retelling of Mahabharata by Amish.
EXPECTATIONS HAD RISEN.... ONLY THE AUTHOR COULD DELIVER IT.... AMISH FAILED SHIVA... :-( WHEREAS THE LOVE OF SATI WAS TO TURN A COMMON MAN INTO GOD, INTURN THE GOD ( THAT AMISH WAS ABLE TO MADE OUT OF SHIVA ) WAS TURNED INTO A COMMON MAN WITH (SEMI-)UNCONTROLLED ANGER.
A long read but was worth it.But lack of explanation of one event in the end.The third part was fantastic.It was a great trilogy.One of the best.Great work by Amish Tripathi.Waiting for more books on this genre from him.
I have always been a fan of Flipkart, thankx for the Super Quick Delivery. It is a great book to read, finally got the much awaited the third book. It was beyond my expectations. I dont want to say anymore. Three Cheers. Sree
Most awaited book of the year..! Awesome 1 and 2 parts.. But, the 3rd book disappoints! I can list the reason as : 1. unclear whether shiva wanted to get personal retribution or destroy evil somras. 2. "oath of the vayuputras" -- nothing is described related to the oath ! the vayuputras hardly have any role. i was expecting some mysterious and interesting plot relating to the special tribe. wish amish had developed this plot more. or else, had a different title for the book - hence not raising expectations. 3. The war strategies are brilliantly written..however, in mid way through the book, u will start feeling it to be slow, tedious and not required. 4. The climax could have been BETTER AND AWESOME if daksha's action consequences would have been punished fitfully. 5. the book abruptly ended. how can neelkanth break his promise to the vayuputras about not using the bhramastra? (i didnt like this). Nonetheless, We all book lovers will definitely read it once.. however, our hunger for a good book read will be quenched just a bit :)
i have read 1st two books and it was definitely a page turner and on every chapter there will be some twist and turns , from the 1st book onward shiva portrayed as a special man , a savior, and above all a god . but in this i cant sort who is the real hero and there is no big decisions he come up wid to b a god like image . but all in all book really was a epic conclusion if u already knew the story of lord Shiva . and thanks to Amish to bring such a good story , cos he transformed a most worshiped god in India into a man WHO CONSIDER KARMA ABOVE OF EVERYTHING. and not least but the last thanks to flipkart for bringing up the book in time .!!!!!!
I enjoyed the first 2 books so i knew this book would be good.in the first book shiva meets the meluhans where he is declared a neelakantan.later he meets sati,she is a vikarma so being together with her seems to be a problem but later he marries her and learns that the true enmy is the nagas.the 3rd book comes after all this .enjoy reading.
The book was a perfect finish to the great shiva trilogy. It has beautifully described the fight for the good against the evil.....and that is what, which differentiates human from god. The best part is the story ends with a hint of a new begining!! I would also thank flipkart for delivering the book within a day!!
When I started reading the first part I could almost imagine it happening and Lord Shiva emerging as the much revered God of today. Hats off to Amish for writing and making Shiva the cool God of today! Flipkart has a tremendous nack of delivering goods at one's doorstep flawlessly. A big thankyou to you Flipkart!
after patiently reading the amateurish written book one could only expect the conclusion to be epic. but the worst was the end which was a huge let down. Sir Amish Tripathi had done an amazing job with the first book but this book seemed to be forced. with expectations so high one could only feel disappointed while reading this book.
Waiting to get my hands on this book with high expectations, of course! Like the first two parts a lot. Wish these ebooks are made available for people outside India as well. Bought the eBook and cancelled the order in vain.
Hats off to Amish.. for relating the fictional plot with the Epic and keeping the sanctity of the Epic intact. It was wonderful reading the last part of Trilogy. Though it was more of a war story yet it kept its grip over the philosophical lessons of life, the dilemma of karma and duties. Going by the depictions and role played by each character its superb imagination and correlation, its wonderful. The meaning of Har Har Mahadev, and portrayal of ordinary human beings turning to God by his actions is awesome. Thanks to Amish for inciting fresh love and respect for Shiva ! May Shiva Bless Amish and his writing !!!
After reading the book i would say all what begins well does not ends well. The first 2 books were so amazing that i was dying to read the last part and as soon as the last part was launched I purchased and gave it a try. But all my enthu got waste after reading the novel. On the other part flipkart was as usual very quick in delivering me the book. All in all a good trilogy to read.
The war part was described in a very lengthy manner.Shive being portrayed as the MahaDev and the blind faith of ppl to him were sometimes been felt as overdose as except for the blue throat there was nothin so convincing he did for the people.The element of romance of Shiva and Sati was cute....The Somras depicted as evil and the philospohy of a Good turning out to become an evil was good.Altogether kudos to the writer for such a thought of this triology, but most of the pages were turned depicting the war scenario and the clumax was rushed in its way. The final part of this Shiva Triology,the much awaited one was worth a read and not more than that...
Sad that it had to end like this...Dont know if the God stopped evil or took revenge of some personal loss in this one (couldnt get more melodramatic)...seriously by the end of it all I just felt that the author himself would feel that he hasnt done justice to what he had built in the first two epics.. Some years down the line, I would love to pick up this trilogy again but will stop at the second book...I dont think the third one does any justice to the beautiful story built up in the first two.'
The final book is well written but too elaborate.. The climax is highly predictable. Amish has put in lot of effort in collecting information and presenting it well. I enjoyed it initially but it started dragging towards the end. It did not meet my expectation :(
There couldn't have been a better version of the story, it holds you till the end. I'd recommend the Trilogy to every reader I've been hearing this a lot that the writing style is nowhere near Dan Brown or Other Writers. Yes, i too felt the same BUT the STYLE is too little to be considered in compared to the Storyline which is an amazing weave of History, Mythology and Fiction. A great deal of research has been put into the book and the characters have been delicately handled which would have been absolutely necessary as a single mistake would have sparked a controversy bigger than anything ever on a book. The philosophy is rich and easy for any reader to grasp due to the simplicity in writing.
After expecting a mammoth from Mr. Tripathi since the release of the previous two hits, this book was a major disappointment and ruined the flavor of the entire trilogy. The 10 reasons are- 1. Everyone expected true Evil to be some sort of a tribe that had been plotting against Meluha, or a sort of conspiracy, and that turns out to be the Somras !! The author did not even bother to mention why the wastes of Somras are toxic. 2.The book is strewn with overly large conversations, mealtime talks and brother to brother chat which is quite unnecessary, making it boring.The Sati and Shiva chemistry is missing, as is that between the other characters. 3.The third is Maharishi Bhrigu, who, after letting out the battle plan and luring Parvateshwar to swap sides, is given a full repealing of punishment and eventually befriends Ganesh and Kartik, which is very absurd. 4.The funniest part is bringing assassins from Egypt, which turned out to be a joke, because it seems that there were no assassins left in India so they had to import some. 5.Sati's apparition talks to Ganesh and Kartik differently, and no further story is given. By the end of the book, it seemed that Ganesh had completely forgotten about his orders from Sati, while what happened to Kartik is unclear. 6.Vayuputra? What Vayuputra? Their oath is absurd as they seemed to be ready to help Shiva and it is a mystery why Mithra had kept his nephew's parentage hidden from the rest of the tribe,and the tribe , too, has a meager role to play in the book. 7.Shiva finally falls for violence, destroying Meluha, when everyone expected him to be merciful and forgive them, it would show his true character, as is expected from a Mahadev. Rather he breaks his promise to Mithra and fires the weapon. 8.Even minor battles are given in such detail that the book turns very boring and the reader develops a tendency to skip chapters. 9.The third eye of Shiva is a mystery and remains so as Amish does not care to reveal anything more,just mentioning that it used to burn up in his childhood and it again swells into a blotch when Sati is killed. I expected the eye to turn into a supreme weapon, or a mind reader as Bhrigu, but in the end nothing at all happens. 10.The Pashupatiastra is as unbelievable as bringing God Zeus into the story would have been, the author may argue that India was scientifically developed but even the launch mechanism described is far from that of a nuclear fusion bomb,making the plot dull. That's all.Thank you.
THIS BOOK BY AMISH,THOUGH HAS SHOCKING SECRETS , IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING BOOK.THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK IS NOT THAT GOOD AND AMISH COULD HAVE MADE THE STORY A MORE ATTRACTIVE ONE.BUT STILL , IT IS NOT A FAILURE TOO.
THE EPIC CONCLUSION ENDS IN AN EPIC WAY.... AMISH SATISFIED ALL THE EXPECTATIONS OF ALL SHIVA TRIOLOGY FANS ... CERTAIN TERMS LIKE PINEAL GLAND & CERTAIN MODERN ABUSE WORDS CAN BE AVOIDED . IN THE FIRST PART ALSO TERMINOLGIES ON OXIDATION, OXYGEN,.ETC ETC... In this Part Somras which turned to be evil is destroyed Shiva..for that a lot of blood shed is there in 600 pages...Extremly violent action in Amish's compelling Narration. Expected By Un expected Climax... Good Read.. You can feel an inner peace after completion of this .. As some one told Amish is emerging as an Indian Paulo Coelho.....
first and foremost, why was this part of the trilogy called the oath of the vayuputras? the vayuputras as such, were only an insignificant part of the entire plot and yet naming the entire book after it didnt make sense at all... and those bits about pariha and the connections between hinduism and zoroastrianism was lift offs from books already available on the subject... and the end just went on and on with details that has definitely killed the prospect of the trilogy in becoming a cult. sadly, shiva who was actually turning out to be a believable person who was all the while fighting evil actually fell for vengeance... which was a big let down! (i bliv the author here tried to put in the facts of the actual tandav of shiva post sati's death)... also, too many questions were left unanswered, as in why did Sati's apparition ask Ganesh to do something else (and what did ganesh actually do?) and ask Kartik something else after her death...!!! also the end of daksh and bhrigu (who were the mastermind behind everything) left things completely wanting and then suddenly, after almost 500 odd pages, the author realised that the book is getting too long and so he just wound it up... definitely loved the immortals of meluha... the secrets of the nagas was better still for it had the elements but somehow the writing made it weak for me... but the oath of the vayuputras has been a huge let down!!! the only good part about this is the delivery by flipkart... take a bow for you are the best in the business of online shopping...
Oh how I wished 4 d end 2 b one of Shiva's dreams.it didn't happen.bt a classy good vs evil tale. It was a great trilogy though. Looking forward 4 more of Amish's books..
Halfway through the book i felt as if i should directly move on to the last five chapters and finish the book. There we some surprise moments such as the redefined character of Sati and her heroics in the battle field and the climax was something that will be definitely debated among the readers. But all in all a disappointing end to a well made series.
After the brilliant first two books, the third book is a massive disappointment. The evil which is finally decided in the book, a six year old fighting as if he is possessed, Shiva's total senseless logic in destroying an entire city for the fault of a few is ridiculous and a blow to the build up in the first two books. Moreover after so much importance given to the Vayuputras they hardly did do anything in the entire book. Their sole purpose was to bring in the next Neelkanth, they botch up that royally and then give the Daivi Astra to a person who at the time being decided he wouldn't use it(but eventually did). Really after the brilliant first two books, this book has come as religious book where it goes on and on how good will never forever remain good. Lets hope the next venture of the author is better than this or at least as good as his first two books. Overall a good series of books.
what evil is for one ,is good for other.. and when shiva started his journey, finds evil& good , both the sides of a coin.... now "the oath of vayuputras" is very very good for me, satisfying, enriching , may be because of my immense interest in mythology, history, etc and honestly i am deep into it..but surely it will not be more fun for beginners and casual readers who find it a extra stretched 6 hrs movie !!!. so only one advice.. read it and feel it , or else it wont pay u back.
After trying to avoid this series as far as possible, I eventually had to give into it. Read the first book, interesting twists and introduction to the characters, 2nd was really awesome setting the plot right to grip my attention. 3rd was a dramatic finish, was expecting unusual twists. Had i read 3rd novel as a standalone, it would not have made much sense to me, but with all three combined as one read - gripping story with decent end. One of the series where I lend the series to friends and make sure I get them back in said time ;)
I had the opportunity to read all the three books "Shiva Trilogy" by Amish Trivedi. The way he as combined mythology, mythological characters, geography of OLD India, through his creative thoughts / logics and writing , has compelled me to conclude that "Shiva Trilogy" is the SHIVA PURANA of KaliYuga.
I ordered all three books of The Shiva Trilogy via Flipkart.com. Flipkart is really the best place for this purpose!! Now about the book and the author, firstly Amish Tripath is a superb writer. The way the story goes, you can not think of putting the book down!! The whole concept in itself was a hit, added to that the writing skills and boundless imagination of Mr. Tripathi!! Though I am a little disappointed about the end of the book, I still recommend this Trilogy to everyone!! hope we see some more great work from Amish Tripathi!!
No so good and exciting as the other two books. Quite sluggish at my place......... Not a good page turner ,lost plot at many places.... Some conversations do not relate to plot, but for the sake of completing the series can be read.
best books i have ever read.best of the triolgy...curiosity jumps every page.the story gets interesting every chapter. interesting narrating style..one can feel the story . must accept amish tripati the best author of india.
Really nice ending... Thrilling... Awesome story-telling by Amish... The Shiva Trilogy is a must-read.... Hats off to Amish... Waiting for Amish's next book... Packaging done by Flipkart is excellent... Thanks to Flipkart...
O Lord Amish..why! a big loss.. it could have been the greatest trilogy in the literary world.. Alas! I am your big fan..i started worshiping Lord Shiva after I read the first two... ohhhhhhhhh. too much pain for a book lover..if the last one of the trilogy doesn't go down well. anyways, thanks...nevertheless you are a great writer
I was waiting to latch on this book and ordered at Flipkart the day it released! I think first two parts were much better and more so because of the last few chapters.. probably it ended cuz it had to end?? not the best of the climaxes which one would have hoped from Shiva. Kind of wrapped up in the end! anyhow, interesting few lines on epic Mahabharata in the end, and hope a book comes on the same from Amish soon! Regards
Amish is an exceptional writer. The world he created out of a simple mythology is enthralling. The plot is good and character build amazing. Just the end of the story which continued for 3 books was somewhat a little down. You can actually guess the end after half of the book. But this series is a must read for all generations. Respect for Sati. Har Har Mahadev! Little down with flipkart's service. I received the book on 4 March, even when I had pre-ordered it
A satisfying end to the trilogy.But the book is very lengthy in terms of 600 pages and also few war scenes elaborated too much. Also Title doesn't links with the book. Seems 3rd book Turned EVIL for Readers' expectations raised after reading 1st and 2nd one!!
Many of the fans of the servies had similar expectations from Oath of Vayuputras as from last book in Harry Potter series. In a way, both had a basic similarity i.e. A central character from whom a lot is expected. In Shiva Trilogy, Amish had an advantage over Harry Potter. The Evil was not clearly defined (Like Voldemart) and many of the characters could easily remain on the 'Grey' side. Still, Harry potter delivered and Oath of Vayuputras fell flat. The author has told in many of his interviews that he started writing the series after a discussion on 'Good Vs Evil' and he wanted to explore that in form of Shiva story. What Amish did not realize is that over the course of two novels, this central theme was not enough. The character of Shiva had to grow beyond both Good and Evil and it never happened. I know being 'Shiva' means absolute equanimity of inner self, the strength of Himalayas. Something which can't be disturbed by anything, absolutely anything. I expected that growth in character. Author limited himself to Good Vs Evil part, infact he missed an oppertunity of self growth to go beyond his initial thought process. Lot of focus was on visual treatment and that is due to Movie offer from Karan Johar. His focus would be on over-secularizing it & will ruin the great story. Still I recomment this book. Read it for a fantastic chapter on Sati's fight with Egyptians. Full marks for this part where Amish did full justice.
After waiting for this book & finally getting to read it, I was so satisfied! The book continues in the style of the previous 2 of the series. Questions are raised & answered, the characters become slightly more philosophical but also more human... showing a lot more emotions. Obviously, The Evil is found & destroyed but the journey is more exciting than anticipated.
Thanks to Flipkart; I had the book on the very first day of its release. Only Mahadev would have the idea how much I have waited for this final instalment. I don't mind the length of the book because it is so overwhelming! I could almost visualise the incidents, sympathize and empathize with the characters. Yes, the end was depressing, but I don't mind that! I always knew Sati was going to die but somehow I chose not to believe it in this regard. Thus, the melancholy was overwhelming! Kudos to the author who presented the entire situation... And the fact that at the end of the book, Shiva still remains nothing but a mortal being was fresh and exactly what I had expected!! No doubt I will miss Shiva...but then... I can always go back to the books. Afterall, thanks to the Shiva trilogy, Shiva is now a living companion, an almost flesh and blood character whom I can reach out and touch! Thanks Amish
This part of the trilogy is awesome. It keeps the reader engrossed, excited, anxious through out the story. You have to sit with fingers crossed for the next scene. Entire part is heart touching especially the fight of Sati. Mr. Amish has done a very great job in depicting our mythology in a real fiction way. Hats off to you Sir.
Its good that everything is explained in details and every details is captured. But as the story moved towards the end, it seems things are tried to speed off and writer wants to just finish it without giving much thought. End is a big Let down specially when you portray a person as Lord of people and his actions and doing are not justified in any sense and seems Lord himself turn evil for the common people of the Land who just follow him blindly.
First & foremost - it could have been easily edited down to 100-150 pages less. A great narrative & clever navouring of story was killed by over clarification & attempt to over simplify. In a good book, author weaves the story, set the stage & leave it to reader's imagination also. Amish seemed cautious to make everything so clarified that I ended up feeling like reading a 6th class text book.
Amish has done it again. The latest of the Shiva triology will keep you glued and leave you teary-eyed at the end. The author keeps you on your toes with it's brisk pace (you never get bored!!) and lets you experience a spectrum of human emotions, from sheer ecstasy to deep pathos, Amish has done it all in his latest venture. Much awaited, this book will touch a chord with all it's readers..The perfect ending!!
After reading the first two books , eagerly waited for this. The way this book was presented made every incidents real.Fantastically written and well crafted. This epic has concluded in a great way. A brilliant work work from the author.
after having read the first 2 books, i had very high expectations from the 3rd installment..and i was extremely disappointed with the way the story unfolds in this book..the protagonist, Shiva who was supposed to demonstrate traits which will help him become a God from being a mere mortal..has been reduced to someone who has just got plain lucky..on the other hand, its his wife Sati who steals the show with her valor..i thought of dis-continuing reading the book several times but had a faint hope that Amish may finish on a high..but in the end..it was complete let-down..
Even though it is well written, there are so many negatives... The story has ventured into technological details too much.. Bringing in Atomic fission and fusion being the worst of it... Some people may think it is brilliant but it doesn't go well. Missing so many good things from the prequels... Doesn't give that excitement or close-to-heart feeling... The death of Sati came out as a poison. It spoiled the whole feel of the book. Started hating the book after that chapter. But..... I didn't put down the book for a straight 15 hour. It is a MAGNET.
The oath of the vayuputras is an awesome book with a superb ending to the Shiva trilogy. Amish has researched thoroughly to make this book. He has also related modern science with ancient mythology which is interesting indeed. Shiva is a real hero. The Shiva trilogy are one of the best books I have ever read. This book is also quite philosophical and inspirational. Only reason I give it four stars because Amish has explained the warfare technologies with excruciating detail which can sometime bore you. Otherwise it is an awesome book.
What I intend to imply by an unfitting end, I mean the entire novel disappoints. Not just the end. It does not feel like a book from the same person who wrote the fantastic "Secret of the Nagas" or â€œThe Immortals of Meluhaâ€� before that. Amish left the readers on such a high after the 2nd book that he had to hit a home run with this one or else, it was doomed to fail. And fail it does! For starters, the book is way too long! It could have easily been brought down to about 300 pages. Would have made it much less painful to read! All the secrets are revealed in the first 100 pages itself! Makes you wonder what else is going to come ahead! Sets one to expect more twists and turns in the point. However, the only thing that did come ahead was page upon page of unnecessary details! Yawwwwwnnnnnn!!! It took me forever to get through the 200s (pages I mean). The author's writing skills are reflected in the latter half of the book (say page 300+), but by then the damage has already been inflicted. I could not be convinced beyond that point. It sure gets interesting, making you want to read further. But thatâ€™s it. It was not enough to make me get over the trauma of the 200s. The end is too filmy to say the least! I am really disappointed with the way the story has ended, after being shaped up so beautifully (with the previous 2 books). It has all the elements of a typical Bollywood climax scene. The book is an abysmal end to a wonderful series. Some amazing characters, superb plots, great writing, fast paced â€“ that is how I would like to remember the Shiva Trilogy. For those who have read and loved the first 2 books, this book would not change much. But yes, it surely leaves one wanting for something far better than what has been dished to us.

this book was no doubt a much awaited one by millions of fans around the world.. and i ordered it on 27 feb 2013 and got it the very next day!!!! flipkart rocks in this aspect!!! congrats and many thanks to the flipkart team! now the book... wow!!! i felt it was really worth the wait and time. the description of Shiva's character and the pain he feels when he finds that his love is gone.....there are simply no words to put that feeling. and also, i found the part where Karthik fights and kills in the war as particularly magnificent. i mean the way Amish sir has described him(Karthik) as the God of War was fantastic!!! and about Lord Ganesh, what a superb warrior and also the most gentlest of the gentle.love him!!! and about Sati... what a woman!!!! she represents almost everything that a woman would want in herself. her death is the part that is outstanding and cries to be heard over everything else in this book. truly very heart touching and a well deserved description. hats off!!! though i did except the book to be little more detailed it was, nevertheless, satisfying. i would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know some clear meaning or an idea of how our Gods would have been, had they been humans before they became the Gods whom we worship.
Finally Completed reading the Epic Finale of Shiva Triology - The Oath of Vayuputras!!! Took me 5 Days due to work pressure :). Nevertheless Completed it. I personally feel First two books were more fast paced and interesting. Yet this Third book wasnt fast paced but the author seemed to be in hurry to finish off the Book and hence certain events could have been in more detail. Also dint like the end. expected 2-3 Chapters more for How Shiva Transformed after knowing the aftermath of his deeds - the effect of Pashupatiastra!!! The Final Battle of Sati was outstanding, superb narration and Heart Touching!!!! Description of Shiva after knowledge of death of Sati made my hairs stand!!! I know it was triology but would love to read more of it.... :) Hoping for the best and Hope Amish will write more mythological books having fictional story like this one. Hats off to Amish. Fantastic Work. Shiv jo naga sang ladha hai vayuputra wo!! Shapath se na apath ho vo jo VAYUPUTRA ho!!!!
I enjoyed the 1st 2 parts of the trilogy more than this one. It missed the punch of the first 2 books. Nevertheless it is a good read. Triology has got me really interested in this genre. Waiting for Amish's next book.
I bought this book from flipkart on the second day of release,the plot of the story is normal and no twists and suspense as the previous ones.At some point while reading you will feel confused how to visualize the war which is being narrated and one more thing this book came after a long time after second part because of this I am very much confused with the characters .It would have been better if the author gave a brief introduction of all important characters in the book like an index
This is indeed a great work from the author. But i think it does not evoke the anxiety and interest to go on reading as the first two. But this does not mean that this a not good. This book still manages to provide good reading compared to many other books out there now.
Anyone who had read the earlier books will not miss out on this one. A great reading experience. My experience in getting the pre-order copy was an ordeal. Flipkart goofed up in the despatch and my copy arrived a whole week after release. Funny part was that they managed to ship it to my cousin who stays two streets ahead on the same day. The internal processes were cumbersome. For some of us Amish fans the delay really bugs us up. Anyway it was my first bad experience with Flipkart and I hope it won't be repeated.
After reading the First book, you cant help being swept away by the mysticism of Meluha! but the Oath of vayuputras was so dissapointing! For a book so big, i would have expected tighter plots and not rambling conversations betweeen Shiva and various characters. Poor Brihaspati has been ignored openly... after the first few pages, i was so unhappy to find him missing! I really hoped he would provide an intelligent solution for the "EVIL" instead it feels like no IMPLEMENTABLE Intelligent purpose has been served even though he was "Researching" for 5yrs!! BAH! its an ok read.. dont expect a lot. p.s-The war scenes has been written well :)
I pre ordered the book and I got it two days after the launch of the book. The packing was good and I got the book in a perfect condition. The book is the third part of the Shiva trilogy and those who have read the first two parts were curious about the book. The book has done justice to its prequels. Thank You Flipkart :)
Trilogy of the Blue Lord's spectacular journey comes 2 an end here...hope He rises once again, hope a series of sequels or a prequel comes soon, dat is my request to Mr.Amish....regarding Oath of Vayuputras, the story continues very well, situations (& moments) are described in details, ending will tear u a bit, Shiva as we know is fierce is all respects, that is why He is the Mahadev..!!! (infact we all are!)...overall superb ending, Mr Amish Tripathi, u deserve credits & applause for this...!!!. Flipkart as usual is Perfecto-as-time, delivery-wise quality-wise, Mr.Milan (Flipkart-Kolkata) thanks for ur cooperation..!! Amish ji, missed ur autograph in Kolkata...hope to meet u whenever u come again..:)
Generally it takes me hardly two days to finish reading a book. This book took two weeks for me to complete. I had to build my interest every now and then while the author was trying maximum to let my interest go. Immortals of Meluha and the Secret of Nagas are very good in comparision with this. Book Not worth Preorder. Could have waited till discounts were given :P :P
It's amazing to know facts about the evil involved in it. The twists are superb.But ends with sorrow. Everyone has a key role which describes briefly about them.The defence formations for the fights and the stratagies for them are very good.
amish has his own skills to keep the reader engrossed.just like the previous two this book too is a definite page turner,but differs in the simple fact that...it just absorbs you into it,it's as if you are in it.a must reader.truly my wait for this book is worth.Amish is no doubt the current India's favorite .waiting for more of amish's magic.
I started reading the Immortals of Meluha after seeing that it was an interesting genre and also that this was an Indian writer trying his hand at this... The first book of the trilogy was good and the action and the interest in the adventure of Shiva in part two increased. The third provides answers, just about maintains interest, but I think the third part misses the punch that any third part of a trilogy should have. Something that should wow and keep the memory of the trilog intact... just seemed a bit of a dampner. However overall, the trilogy is a good easy read...
The Oath of the Vayuputras is easily one of the most awaited novels and Amish is surely India's current favourite. I've waited for the release of this book ever since i finished The second book of the triology and i pre-ordered it as soon as i saw it on Flipkart. Flipkart, as always did an excellent job of delivering the book on the Morning of the release in Bangalore, which happened to be exactly two days before my 10th board exams. I told myself that i wouldn't start the book until my exams were over but what started off as 'only 20 pages' then became 'okay, just a few more' and i ended up finishing the book before the second exam. Now, that's how addicting the book is. It was a good read, but the ending was sad.The Shiva Triology has got me really interested in Mythology. Waiting for Amish's next book.
I must say I am surprised by many of the reviewers here giving poor reviews. I started reading the trilogy just few weeks back and hence read the three books back to back. Maybe thats why I enjoyed them better. But still this book is definitely awesome. It may be huge, but not boring or slow. I read it in just over a day flat. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Hats off Amish.
I never expect, i will be affected by this book for so long. The impact of this book on me kept low at my work for minimum two to three days. I liked every aspect of the book except detailed minucule description of any place or thing in the book, its very difficult to imagine from author points of view in depth. Still i love this book. I like the overall concept of the book "Nettri kann thirapinnum kuttram kuttrame !! " Hats off to Amish. As said by him in the ending, will hope for the story of Mahabaratha from his pen very soon.
To start up with I am a huge fan Immortals of meluha and Secret of Nagas. I actually loved the characterization of all d characters especially Ganesh. Was expecting a lot from d author but this time around it was a little disappointing. According to me in this book the author concentrated more on war and war strategies which was nice but was overdone. When comparing the its previous parts the surprise element was lacking throughout the book. After a huge buildup for the climax I was expecting something extraordinary but it was a bit of letdown.. It was shocking but a complete letdown.. Overall this triology is my favourite kudos to the author for his imagination because even though I am an Atheist it was a fascinating experience for me..
Well this was a highly anticipated launch but it doesn't live upto its expectations. It's highly predictable, conversations are boring and there's no suspense. Looks like the author was bored too. Could give a miss!!!
Loved each and every minute of the book. Amazing read and unputdownable. Had read some review which stated that the final part of the trilogy is disappointing and not upto the mark. However, these reviews were proven wrong. Loved it!
Best Book I read with the proper ending. The plot has good storyline with neither deteriorating nor losing the strong resemblance with the known name of ancient times. Worth waiting and advance boking. Will eagerly wait for the next work of Author.
This man makes me man with his power of holding on to his readers relentlessly.... amazing style... Amazing information about Indian Mythology. Wonderful to know the secretes revealed in awesome way and I bet this is better than the best.... This is far better than Meluha and NAGA too..... :)
All three books of Amish Tripathi are wonderful. Not only are they entertaining and page turners but emotion it evokes linger in your hearts for days together. Very few try and tackle the topic of good and evil in such rational and philosophical way. The westerners have a black and white view of good and evil but our eastern culture has gone beyond the normal thinking and found it to be a dilemma, an enigma requiring careful handling. His adaptation of mythological names (Charatcters) in to a meaningful and rational story is just superb. Of course he needs to quote sanskrit scriptural texts a little more correctly and implied meanings , wherever derived, should be shown honestly.
Already read with previous 2 books i was excited to read this. Amish, one of the finest writer, who have potraited things in very simple, logical and understandable manner. All his explanations are great. I love this triology.
Having read the first two books of the trilogy I was expecting a hell of an end but it was a huge letdown. Story starts from where it ended and nothing is left to imagination,everything is so predictable that you will get bored. The author has made the plot un-necessarily lengthy. The beginning is good but the end is slow and not even required in so much detail. Read this only if you are a die hard fan of previous books of this series.
As usual the third book in Trilogies that I have read are not as good as the preceding twobooks. This maybe because of too much expectation from the author for surprises. Nevertheless a book to be read. First half was boring but as the story carries forward the momentum is created. I liked the most was potrayal of Sati in the book also in the previous book. She is truly Mesmerising. Sati grows in Stature and Shiva i felt was stagnant. Amish has to be thanked for giving us these three entertainers
First of all, thanks for Flipkart for their excellent delivery... Had been waiting for this book since quite a time..but considering the first 2 books of the trilogy, this book has been a bit disappointing...the plot picks up at few occasions, but on other it lags..anyways worth a read..
Flipkart made a great effort delivering the product!! Yeahie!! It would have been worth had the author given a little credit to his readers to understand and really think rather than lay an elongated plot with absolutely no excitement as the last part of the trilogy. Very disappointed with this one!!
Flipkart you totally flipped me off the kart with yo excellent service. Hats Off. Continue the good work. About the product worth the buy. Amish has always surprised me with his writing skills. Fabulous.
It is hard to understand what Amish had in mind when writing this book in particular. Were the loopholes left in deliberately for thinking readers to question? Were deep philosophies embedded into the story to make readers question themselves? Were a few scenes choppy to prod readers into questioning what might have been? There are these questions and a lot more. The action does not "jump off the page" as in the previous books. What the reader will find though are carefully detailed scenes that sketch a layout, aided by good imagination. Sections that are riddled in deep philosophies, probably mirrors Amish's thoughts, are strewn throughout the book. The book manages to take those who "live a story" through a vast range of emotions. There are gut-wrenching scenes and those that make one leap up with joy. But, could Amish have made a better fist of it? Yes. After The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, Amish deserved to finish on a much bigger high. The book is due to receive its share of brickbats but credit must also be given to Amish for the Trilogy as a whole. Loopholes and a plethora of questions apart, the Trilogy has managed to shed light on much of what was in a more believable manner. It is an attempt that must be praised as much for its gumption as for its execution. The book ends with the promise of exploring other Indian mythology. I look forward to Amish's next book, not because he is a brilliant writer, but because he is a brave one.
I really liked the 1st two books. Those books gave all the necessary setting for an epic finale. But was it worth waiting for. My answer would be no. I was really disappointed with the book. It is not gripping as the first two books. The secret is revealed earlier. There are no mental conflicts that keeps you engaged as in the first two books. And the ending was thoroughly disappointing. All in all keep your expectations low and read the book. You may like it.
Well scripted, a fitting conclusion in a way, though a little jumpy and discordant at times! The first 20-25 pages lagged, but beyond that the story gripped you. I was always curious to know how Amish would handle Sati's demise, pretty decently handled. Shiva's character is brought to fullness, but you can't but help escape that little niggling discomfort with him, a feeling of stilted responses, a little not quite there (perhaps, it is just me). Nandi, Ganesh and Kartik are developed into fuller, rounded individuals. Would I read more book from Amish. Possibly would. Does he compare to the international fantasy writers that I have read and know of. No! he has a long way to go, as yet. Hopefully, fingers crossed, he will get there...
Lemme get this straight... Amish ain't Tolkien... Well, not yet... So do not expect an LOTR beating classic... But Shiva Trilogy stands it's ground with its own well-earned right... The guy has put in some serious work... Encourage him... Buy the books... Let him write more... Who knows... India could yet produce it's own answer to Tolkien...
Start with a fine story line but a poor ending to the trilogy. Actions done by the characters are not justified at some instances which contradict the very nature of the characters portrayal (again this is my opinion).
Amish has yet again carried his invention artistically. His aesthetic senses are at its zenith tinged with creativity. Unlike TIOM or TSOTN this one is very fast moving. A new adventure and logic surfaces on each page. The deepest remorse and the toughest decisions of human life has been woven into a fine fabric.
Read the awesome book a few days ago.... Was thrilling right from the start through to the end... It is the best in the Siva Trilogy. Exceptional pictorial quality.. Especially the war. Siva trilogy is one of the best fiction book on myth you will read...
After two initial well written books, this third books is a major disappointment. It seems Amish was not himself writing this 3rd book of his trilogy. The story is being rushed as if the writer wanted to finish the book as soon as possible.
An epic conclusion to this "modern epic"... That's what it is. Wonderfully scripted, keeps you hooked till the end... & a story that almost all of us are so acquainted with is reinvented at the end... Love, Deception, Friendship, Loyalty, Pride, Bravery, Treachery, Respect, Honor, it's got almost every flavor one can think of............. A masterpiece by Amish
Hats off to amish for writing such an interesting and intriguing book on lord SHIVA . The way the book has been written is commendable and the take on the mythology and relating it to some beforehand known incidents and facts easily tells you the BRILLIANT creative mind of author. This book has infused a new and a higher level of respect and love towards my GOd--> SHIVA . I know its just a fictional work but who knows, it maybe the lord himself telling us his life and struggle to evade evil under the face of Amish . But whatever it maybe , altogather it was fun and a verry different reading experience for me ... The Immortals of Meluha made me like the book. The Secret of Nagas made me fall in love with the book. The Oath Of Vayuputras made me believe in the book and the fact that evil will always be ta'en out of the equation !
Great delivery, flipkart; a nod to the author for a normal novel I can understand why many people have given this book 5 star reviews, fantasy is rarely read in India. To a person like myself who reads a lot of foreign fantasy, this book rates just "normal". The main draw is ofcourse, Shiva. The idea that someone mortal could go on to become a great god is an impressive idea and Amish must be praised for it I wish that there was another way - rather than a blue throat that helped Shiva rise to the status of a god. Through this novel, things were a bit pallid, but it reached its own climax. What happened some chapters before the end was emotional. I cared enough for the characters to feel the pain of their injuries, but after that, the climax just vanishes. The author is not creative enough to make the sort of ultimate ending this novel deserves Mr.Amish is inherently a marketing professional. He may worship Shiva, but that doesn't change anything. What he wants is money. He is writing these books not for himself, like any good writer should - but as a spectacle.
I was pleasantly surprised when I started this trilogy but it grew to admiration as I finished it. The writing may not be perfect but this series has a soul of its own. I was always a believer that the logical glory of the Old days slowly transformed into Dogmas and this story beautifully captures how that can happen. Also the characters in this book are defiantly human unlike other books which involve Gods. This book was an apt end of a refreshingly new series.
After a long wait..finally we have the third book of Shiva trilogy in hand..and as usual Amiss has not disappointed us. A great beginning with great action and drama..though the book misses the charm of Immortals of Meluha or the action of The secret of the Nagas, yet Oath of the Vayuputras is by far the most matured and composed of the three books..it reveals that Amiss as a writer has also grown as his Shiva grows and matures with each novel.. great reading guys.. u all must have a copy of it!!
A perfect 10 to Amish for writing this (infact all the books of shiva trilogy). Oath of the vayuputras is simply Amazing!!!!! Every page is full of surprises and keeps you at the edge of your seat........... I would give anything to become a part of the story if only that could happen. All in all its a MUST READ!!!!!!!
The 3rd book of the 'Shiva Trilogy' series is so much fun..It gives a compelling ending to this series. This fantasy novel is so interesting. The story of this book is unpredictable ( if u hv already read the other two ). This book shows that the author is so Imaginative and creative as well.. Really awesome, if u r looking for an amazing fiction book. Go for this 1, it's surely gonna impress u
I think this series has come a long way.Amish gave his best be it the design of the cover page, the buzz.The book is simple read and well concluded connecting to the mythological facts.This series will encourage more wirters to come with up fantasy stories rather than the boring love stories of nikita singh and chetan bhagat books.The narrative style is much more detailed than the second book in which the author skipped many time periods, where as in this part he took his time and explained everything in detail.Shiva trilogy has certainly rasied the standards of fantasy writing by indian authors.
Awesome Book...Slow moving story...Gr8 work by someone 38 yrs old..Amish has done a gr8 job explaining philosophy all along with his book...gr8 read...He prooves what they say in the Lord of the rings"History become legend, legend became a myth...what was once important has now been forgotten"...Thanks for reminding us Amish...
Each page is filled with action and excitement. Go for it..Amish did a great work on this third book. It was like completely lost in the world of Shiva. Plot is good, though some questions are left unanswered like if all know Vayuputras decides who will be neelkantha then Y did daksha sent nandi n his men to search for neelkanth for 100 year.
The last of the Shiva trilogy is as superb as the rest. A fitting conclusion for sure. The pace doesn't slow down for even a second, and leaves you turning pages at a frantic speed. I had to actually put the book down for a gasp of breath. But this is my truth. And then there is your truth. And as for the universal truth...it doesn't exist!! Also praises for FLipkart for delivering the book to me without any delays. As always, impeccable service. My only grudge would be that the delivery men don't carry the card readers most of the times to enable card-on-delivery.
This book broke records of sorts. . :) I finished it in 15 hours flat. :) its a very compelling tale and a beautiful end to the trilogy. out of the world writing and great story telling. I would rate it a 4.8 (cant show that on the stars) for the only reason that the climax could have been better written. The end of EVIL was just too quick, sudden and didn't quite allow me to visualise.
This is the third part of Shiva's Triology.First I would like to thank Flipkart for their prompt delivery.The book of the series is also as good as the first twon though i have not finished it.Would advise people to buy all the three books and enjoy it.It is anyway available on Flipkart/.
I kind of overwhelmed by the first two books and pre-order this one as soon as it up for ordering. Flipkart as always excellent at its service deliver it at 27th Feb very early in the morning. It took me more time to read it than two of its preprocessor because it lost pace at some point of time. The feelings i get when reading this book is, Amish started the book, then somebody tell him to hurry, so he crammed so many things it few chapter, then he slowdown again. Besides awe-full exaggeration in some place(like a 6yr boy with 2000 men kill a army of 75000) out of 54 chapters only 4, maybe 5 chapters are dedicated to vayuputras and their oath (actually when vayuputras come to play in the story, Amish started to cram many things up in a chapter). So I kind of sad about this book. On the other hand as he referred as "Indian Dan Brown", this book is way better than Dan Browns current last book "the lost symbol". :)
I pre-ordered the book and it came right on time on the date of release ! Kudos to flipkart for that Now coming to the book, even though the initial story was dragging explaning about temples and things in detail ( Maybe amish must've wrote to give a clear picture to his fans abroad ). As the chapter progress, you get the feeling that you got while reading Nagas : The thrilling effect. When the book nears the end, amish enthralls you with some amazing twists which will surely make you stare at the book with your mouth open. On the whole, it was indeed a worthy finish to the epic trilogy minding the fact that, he is a first time novel author and he had to finish the book with high expectations. Amish carried the job pretty well, hats off to him !
The Oath Of The Vayuputras : There ends the Shiva Trilogy !! The book does live up-to its hype.It delivers what it promises; legendary wars, splendid battle scenes. mesmerizingly beautiful descriptions, right blend of emotions and a decent pace. The pre-climax is where the book scores big time.It shocks you !! For all the Shiva Trilogy fans, this is a damn good read.A fitting farewell awaits you. Har Har Mahadev !! P.S- It's mostly the awe-inspiring "MAHABHARATA" which is next in line. Can't ask for more !!
For starters, I loved Immortals of Meluha n The secrets if Nagas so much that I read and re-read it a number of times... Just finished reading this.. n it was disappointing! Firstly, it was more on war & war strategies.. which according to me was not that convincing... Next, lord Brighu went 'off' for what reason? He was a strong character n all of sudden he is nothing? that was odd! Then the most let-down part of the Trilogy was it started saying 'what if Lord Shiva was person who actually lived centuries ago', but ended the series saying Lord Shiva actually lived centuries ago. The ending was bad! People who want to go ahead n read it.. all the best!
oath of vayuputras? Why this title? I really couldn't figure out the relevance of this title. Book is nothing like the previous two. I had to push myself to continue reading hoping something would Come which will give a twist to the story. To my dismay nothing like that happened. Biggest disappointment was the end. It seems the end wasn't given much thought about. It would have been better If Amish had taken some more time and charted out the end well. Shiva didn't emerge out as God.. There was nothing in his deeds which raised him to that level.
Overall the book is a must read, if one has read the earlier two parts.. However, at some time in the story, Sati overshadows Shiva's power of fighting the Evil. The end could have much better....since it leaves the reader a lost and sad feeling....(Unlike the earlier two books) However, Amish's attempt to describe Shiva in all books have been marvellous...!!
Not that the first one was great, but the novels have been progressively disappointing. The war just drags on an on till it is the reader who becomes battle weary. Not a good ending to what is already an over hyped trilogy...
'Meluha' was good, 'Nagas' - even better, and then after a long expectant wait arrived the Shiva swan song " The Oath of the Vayuputras' which turned out to be just about average. The pace of the narrative ossilates between 'slow' and 'racy', but is always rather laboured. The parallels drawn with extant mythology - the dramatic mainstay of the previous volumes, seem hackneyed and forced in the 'Vayuputras'. Then again, though Zoroastrianism is an Indo-Irainian religion and parallels are drawn in terms of mythology, introducing our Persian neighbours as the 'Vayuputras' was rather a long stretch. Can't help feeling a bit let down.
The book is nowhere near the first two, a big let down. Could not connect with the story and the author failed miserably with this one. The one star that I have given is for Flipkart's fast delivery. Had been waiting for this one for a long time and it spoiled the magic of the earlier two books also. Vayuptra chapter was the nail in the coffin, nothing interesting....too predictable...and a very bad ending....
Firstly, the book was delivered to me in the afternoon of 27th feb'13, so full marks to flipkart for this. The book while has a good flow, keeps the reader enthralled and accounts of various battles, related emotions etc are very well written, but the plot overall is weak. Somewhere it seems to belittle Shiva's character, except for his moral integrity and being a good warrior no other god like qualities seem to be there. The character of parvateshwar seems to be much better in hindsight. There are lot of questions which just remain unanswered. Having finished the book am slightly disappointed.
First thanks to Flipkart for delivering the book on the day of release..Me being a slow reader coupled with the story being draggy, it took me a week to finish the book :)...First things first; amazing story on d whole..Imagining God to be a human and building a story that needs to do justice to all the characters that legend speaks of (Shiva, Sati, Kali, Ganesh, Karthik, Nandi to name a few) is no easy task...Amish has managed it well. Kudos to the author...He has made sure that he gave all the characters the attention they deserve..the heroes of the book Sati ( I prefer her to Shiva) and Shiva linger in your minds, after you finish the book, in their own ways...Though the Oath of Vayuputras gives a nice finish to the entire story...of the 3 parts I liked the secret of Nagas d best; in terms of d story d twists and d overall content, the 3rd book is no match to the 2nd...However bits n pieces of the Oath of Vayuputras touches u soo deep unlike d other 2 parts...I am not sure of the other characters but dear Sati would sure stay in my memory for sometime atleast...
Review Zone => The Oath Of The Vayuputras => The much awaited concluding part of the Shiva Trilogy, unlike what others say, meets our expectations and hopes in every single aspect. The Vayuputras ameliorates to the success of the Trilogy and yet once again showcases that Books have become quite a rage in India in the present times. It's contiguous, Belligerent, frevent and a lot more add up to the spice. The Plot => Shiva meets Brahaspati and Evil is finally revealed. He goes in search of the Vayuputras with the help of The Vasudevs to Pariha. He meets The Mithra (leader of the Vayuputra Council). And the true identity of (Lord) Manobhu is revealed. The Mithra also narrates how Shiva became the Neelkanth and who administered the Vayuputra medicine to him as well as his relationship with Shiva and his knowing of Shiva was the Neelkanth. Then, Shiva asks the Mithra for a help and he readily agrees. At around this time, Meluha's Daksha joins hands with Ayodhya's Dilipa headed by Lord Bhrigu and try to assasinate Shiva, The Fraud Neelkanth even when Lord Bhagirath (s/o Dilipa & Prince of Ayodhya) is in favour of the Neelkanth. The Branga alliances with Neelkanth and takes control over Magadh, the easy way for the Ayodhya army to reach Meluha. Now the Ayodhyans have only one choice: move to Meluha through the dense forests even though it's time-consuming. Lord Parvateshwar (married to Anandmayi: sister of Bhagirath) forces himself to join Meluha against the Neelkanth saying the Country is always first even when he was blindly devoted to the Neelkanth. But Daksha has other plans. When Lord Bhrigu leaves Meluha with Parvateshwar and the Meluhun-cum-Ayodhyan forces to Karachappa, call on for a Peace Conference with The Neelkanth thinking it will give him a chance to finish him even if it against Lord Ram's rules. But as Neelkanth was in Pariha, Sati goes to Meluha and unfortunately due to a turn of events is killed and dies a brave death. When the Neelkanth comes to know about this, he is enraged. He takes control over Devagiri and intends to destroy Devagiri with Pashupatiastra, the weapon of Lord of Animals, given by the Mithra. He asks people to vacate the city and destroys Devagiri with people who supported The Evil in the city. Conclusion => I disagree with many others who say that Shiva shouldn't have used the Pashupatiastra being a God. All in all #The Oath of the Vayuputras would never dissapoint it's readers. Hats off Amish - The Official Fanpage! A new Author born! Om Namah Shivaiy! Shiva Rocks!
As always a riveting read, even though 600 pages will glide you through, a superb calls presentation, drives you through emotions, enthrall you with spectacle presentations , emotional ride through the a historical characterization..
Amish clearly lost the plot with this 3rd book. I really liked the first 2 but the 3rd book was a huge disappointment. The title "The Oath of the Vayuputras" was totally inappropriate, the cover page, unlike the first 2 books, was disappointing.....wonder if he will ever be able to recreate his magic....
I was very much excited to read the book. Even I pre ordered the book on flipkart. All i can say that this book is most disappointing of all three. The plot is very loose and predictable. How can a person so against whole part of book gets completely with shiva in the end. the end is not at all justified. Can say 70% unsatisfied..................... :((
The ultimate novel in the trilogy disappoints in the legend of the Neelkanth and the role of the Vayuputras. But what is lost in the hero is gained in the heroine....and oh what a heroine Amish conjures!! The consummate daughter,lover,wife,mother,sister,general,princess,friend, warrior and, above all, woman.........if only all women could be like Sati!!
Simply amazing read!! A perfect ending to the Shiva Trilogy! It cant get any better! Waiting for Amish sir to come up with his next series, The Mahabharata, as it seems to be!! it was never about an epic battle, all it was about taking the Evil out of the equation which finally had to happen and the ending could not have been any better! Har Har Mahadev!!!
This was one of the novels I have been expecting for the last one year. It reminded me of the days of Harry Potter when I used to wait for months. I pre-ordered this book on the first day but after reading it completely I am totally disappointed. Not that the book is bad - it is ok - but when compared with the Secret of Nagas and for that matter even Immortals of Meluha - The book simply doesnt live up to the expectations. May be author was under pressure to release the novels. The first two books contained enormous twists, plots, sub-plots. The third book contained nothing - literally nothing. It contained only elaborate narration about the surroundings. Expecting much more from you Mr. Amish. Please do not disappoint us next time.
Dear All, The oath of vayuputra is 3rd & final part of Shiva trilogy. 1st part Immortals of Meluha is best among all. It shows how faith & trust on your ability can win the battle. I waited for oath of vayuputra too eagerly bcz of the end of 2nd part. It keeps you waiting for the final part of the book. The starting of the 3rd book is too good. It revel what is the Evil & how Neelkanth won over it. But the end is not as satisfying as expected. Amish could have end the book with much more inspiring. But in all, its really gr8 novel & must read for every age group. & kudos to flipkart which delivered the book on 27 morning itself.
When I first started with "Immoratals of Meluha", I didnt had the slightest idea that it might be written with such brilliance.... After that I went on with "The secret of nagas"..... After reading that I was eagerly waiting for a thrilling end for this series... And no points for guessing it really does... Amish has produced another brilliant book and demonstrated the tag of "Triumph of good over evil" ... He is poised to be the Paul Coelho of the East.... Three Cheers
Let me applaud effort put in by author, really like the way plot was built but alas the abrupt ending spoiled all built up. All the pressure was boiling up and I was really looking forward to read about the final war, about how great warrior Shiva was and how he brought end to the Evil. Some how I feel ending was too abrupt and too much borrowed from other sources. Such an amazing thought and story where even gods have to earn the right to be called GOD. Karma is probably the only real universal truth.
The book starts off from where it left "The secret of the Nagas". The first 45-50 odd pages can be a flash back journey where the author wants its readers to be in sync with the previous two books. If you can get through those 50 pages, you are in for a literary, philosophical and story-telling treat. And at the end yo are bound to say "Best ever trilogy!" A must read for all. The last 100 pages or so are the icing on the cake named "The Shiva Trilogy". Amish Tripathi, hats off to you. Salute your skills. Hope Lord Neelkanth gives you the strength to write more and the one you promised to at the end of the book!
First of all THANKS A LOT to Flipkart for timely deliver of the book, received it at 10.30 am on 27th Feb. :) I started reading this much awaited last book of The Shiva Trilogy with a lot expectations and was very thrilled to read first chapter as it set the mood for the book at a very high point. But as I kept reading the book along it started getting a little slow and I could not find the "Wooo" moment in the book after that. Over all satisfied with the book when compared with other Indian Authors' books but was disappointed when compared with Amish's previous two books of This Epic Shiva Trilogy. Giving it 3 stars out of 5.
1. Some of the major characters and tribes are almost non-existent. e.g. Kali, Ganesh, Vayuputras etc. 2. The protagonist is never shown in action in this book, all of a sudden he became a side character and the side character like Kartik became the most important character 3. The female lead Sati has been continuously a let down. She was a powerful character and yet Amish continuously forced her to commit mistakes again and again. 4. If you know the mythology behind Mahadev then the book will be way too much predictable. 5. Amish had stuck with the events which had happened in the mythology and didnt even try to create his own myth. because he was too busy to scientifically justify those events. 6. The ending does not justify the trilogy. He transformed a man into a god in the first two parts but failed to maintain the character's god stature in this book 7. And no epic battle in the end. Srsly Amish what were you thinking man!!!! you have to read this because... welll..gotta end this series..... this book is like "You should read it or have to read it" its not a "Must read" like its predecessors All in all this book was a let down for me..may be I was expecting too much!!! And to Flipkart. Hats of to you guys...when it comes to packaging and services..till now you are the best!!!..
The third book of Shiva Trilogy is a big let down by Amish there is to much expilation, you can actually turu 5 pages with not loosing the plot. The ending i just didn't feel like reading. I bought this 3rd. book of Amish in advance,but next time will have to think and order for Amish books. I hope his next is as good as his first 2 books, which I had to finish at one go. All the best.
This eagerly awaited last installment is a fast read. Thanks to flipkart which delivered on time and messaged the correct delivery delivery details the book reached right on the release date. I would say the focal point of the story is final battle of Sati. I found it would mesmerising and heartbreaking. Rest of the story either built itself to it or was an offshoot from it. This book is not literature but it is definitely a story worth reading and rereading and an adventure quite unique. I would rate it 4 on 5 for that factor only.
Shiva trilogy overall was one of the best story I came across in my life. Seriously didn't like the end. Felt highly disappointed that many things were finished in a rush. Could have finished better.i felt the story deserved better end,but its author wish that he has finished it in such manner.will respect that,anyway I always will keep Shiva trilogy close to my heart.
With this book many new secrets are exposed and shiva's character comes out in full , it's great with more emphasis is given to action part of it with more light is shed on other characters also the end could have been greater , is little less twisted but again if i think from author's point of view , it's probably the best end that could have been possible for this great saga of shiva
I bought the book with huge expectations and even had a premonition that it might be a let down and i am afraid it is. The plot i.e the revelation of what is evil and the fight against the evil is really dissappointing after the suspense that the first two books created.You can read it coveniently skipping a few pages without losing out on much of the story.
the awesome service of flipkart as it delivers same day of the book release and the book is marvelous and it is no way secondary to its previous books.I felt this is not a story but a screenplay of a movie and the English is little bit tough when compared to its previous books but it is okay.Amish's way of narration is excellent as the same as its previous books and i'll recommend others to read this book.
A lazy effort at riding some controversy without even the common decency to come up with an original universe. This man and others like him are an affront to writing and fantasy. Its ok if you can't be Tolkien, but atleast don't bring down the level of fantasy and fiction to common plagiarism.
I should say that I am slightly disappointed by the book - it provides the same fast pace and good story telling. But some of the linkages between the book's characters and traditional Hindu mythology seem contrived. Also, while the literary value was always on the lower side and this series is readable only for the story telling, I expected this book to improve on this dimension as well, which unfortunately was not the case. All in all, a decent read but a couple of notches below the previous 2. A rating of 3 because I am not satisfied with the closure this book has provided to my journey with this series.
You can judge this book from its cover. Its a high paced novel which keeps you glued to your seat. Its lengthy but adds more detail to the plot which was not there in the first two parts of the shiva trilogy. If you have read the last two books then this has to be a must buy! Incase you havent, then you should read the the other 2 books before starting this one! My Advice - Any long journey or nothing to do at home ? Then grab this book and enjoy.
I don't know may be its because of our high expectations or cant accept god to do the way he does in the novel it was a quite dis appointing ending for me... The first 2 books were brilliant though.. Great work Amish...The last one could have been a lot better !!!
Really disappointed with this book. was eagerly waiting for the 3rd part of trilogy --------- but really no comparision with last two books ... every thing is soooooooo predictable. And vayuputras ???? --- almost don't exist --- Bhrigu -- So much build up but no final output Shiva --- seems like a normal human at the end. Ganesh --- No role in the book -- it's Karthik all the way
A very nice start to the book but the plot has been needlessly convoluted at the end. There were so many sub-plots which were picked up at some point in the novel but eventually had either no significance or no end at all. Overall, worth a read for the excellent description of the action sequences. The story revealing Shiva's selection for the task has not been too convincing. I, personally, would have given Shiva more credit for what he has accomplished rather than making the reader feel just like Shiva himself - 'Everything has been mere luck so far'. Surely, neither a fitting end to the trilogy nor a perfect tribute to Lord Shiva. It is going to work as novel if you forget Shiva's real life image :-)
Thoroughly enjoyed reading the book after waiting for almost 2 years for the 3rd book. Few loose ends here and there but overall a must read for those who haven't read the first 2 parts. Amish is on verge of becoming a very good Author. Awaiting the great Mahabharat....:)
an epic ending to the great series. Will miss reading shiva triology. Har Har mahadev. Not the best in the series, yet interesting. Had to skip few because it was over explanatory taking mind off the experience (like songs in movies :)). Overall a great book which has shadows of spirituality,mythology,history
I pre ordered the book and was so much excited about it. And it paid... The continuation to the last 2 books had the same pace and grip to the story. Some times it is so great, when i felt the characters coming out of the pages. The description of past events were so clear and concise that it was even impossible to go for a break. I completed reading the novel in just one day. No work but ' BRAVO' to Amish on this great book...
Interesting as it was w.r.t his last two amazers, expectations were high on this one and probably Amish was just eager to finish the book and bring to readers. Too many confusing characters, unanswered questions(the reason this was the last book was to unravel everything) and many more. The end was really disappointing. It could have been much better. D weapon should not have been used. A city paid for one man's treachery was no justice and some1 of the calibre of Lord Neelkanth no matter what remorse he was filled with, should have understood. Book is good for those who are just obsessed with suspense and still be okk with no proper sense. I wouldn't say waste of money and i learned some good values from this book but could have been a true epic..
Good Book by the author....!!! Must read...:) But the flavour is missing compared to the first two books of the trilogy!!! Where i was eyes stuck on the book....! Could have been more better.. After waiting for such long time, actual book went down on the expectations...!!!
This book falls way short of expectations! The first two parts were miles ahead of this one. Reading this book, one feels like Amish has tried finishing the novel in a hurry. Much of it seems like a contemporary novel, with little to do with the mythology I expected. Also, the book is unable to continue with the note of excitement it left of in the last book. Many details have been ignored. Half way through the book and I'm already bored. Don't feel like reading it further, whereas the first two books were so engrossing that I messed up my exams reading them. But we all have read the first two parts, and hence we WILL read the third part. So read it quickly and get it over with! Bottom-line: The book is average. Slightly on the lower side. Nothing great about it. Read it to complete the trilogy. Had Amish not raised our expectations so much, I might not have been so disappointed.
A very bad end to a very great start how can u kill satii at the end this was uncalled for. and novel was very lengthy and so boring this was very unexpected. guys please dont waste your time i don't think anybody would have expected such poor writing from amish
The first 2 books were crazy and i couldnt put them down but compared to them the last one though bigger in size but failed with the content...it was fine but not great!!! I wish it was even closer to the first 2 books but somehow it couldnt even come closer. The characters this time we old and not much new was added in this book.
The book is a big letdown for me. The first two books worked because they always had a mystery to reveal which keeps you engaged. But in this book the mystery gets revealed very early and the rest of the book becomes a long yawning read in anticipation of something good and unexpected which never happens. In all three books the character Shiva gets immense respect and devotion from other characters in story, but never does he do any deed to deserve that kind of status. So I thought maybe he will discover himself and attain a god like ability and stature at some point in the story. But sadly it did not happen. And therefore not only this book, it ruined my liking of previous two books as well. Because the anticipation with which I had read previous two books, also has gone void now.
After reading the secret of nagas, I didn't have much expectations. But seems Amish has improved a lot in his writing style. There is one particular chapter, "Last Kill" that is really amazing. The first book has established Shiva as Mahadev. There isn't much in this book that improves his legacy that is already established. That is one point where the book has disappointed. Though the book is quite long, it never gets boring. The whole series is a definite read for someone who wants to get an idea on the evolution of the religion.
Amish is too good with his narrations. Very few writers have the skill to engross the reader. Amish is excellent at doing it. His thought process about visualizing the mythological characters as living being with certain traits make you think differently. Hope we teach our young India about values like this.
Within the first 100 pages, I was haunted by the feeling that Amish Tripathi probably had the following written on a post-it that he stuck prominently to his screen when writing this book: 1) Tie up all loose ends! 2) Rationalize the legend and all actions around him! Everything must be given a scientific reason, nothing can be attributed to supernatural/superhuman possibilities. 3) Complete the story! Since you promised a trilogy, discovering that there is enough material for a fourth book is a no-no! 4) Retain the realism and passion of the first two books! The Secret of the Nagas (Shiva Trilogy, #2) slipped a little bit from the high standards that The Immortals of Meluha set, so compensate... compensate! I think the author prioritized #1 so much, that he traded off some of the other priorities, with the end-result being that the book ended up a little flatter than the first two, and the overall effect was just a little disappointing. However, to the author's credit, to pull off a story of this quality is in itself a huge achievement, and the Shiva series raises the bar higher than any Indian fiction has achieved in the fantasy/mythology space in a long time. Part of the disappointment for me, is due to my background as a science fiction fan. The distinction between quality sci-fi and pulp sci-fi is the plausibility of the fantastic science described in various situations. I appreciate Amish Tripathi's commitment towards rationalizing the fantastic, but to the average scientific, some of the scientific stuff is even more far-fetched and implausible than the super-hero stuff he seeks to avoid at all costs. Some of the sub-plot twists were simply weird, I thought this came from trying to tell too many stories simultaneously. Some stories, or sub-stories - if there is such a thing, have a life of their own, and tend to hijack the plot if you succumb to the temptation of letting them take themselves to a "logical end". A good example of how this can be handled, is The Lord of the Rings, where the author simply reduces the character-count to a much more manageable list. The Dune series also suffered from the same over-characterization that this book suffers from, with similar results. There were brilliant moments in the story, moments where I felt the pace was as gripping as in the previous books, and these parts hold the book together for the sometimes heavy 535 pages. But the ratio of "number of pages read per brilliant moment", is simply lower as compare to the previous two books. This is probably an example of the predecessors leaving too high a bar for the last instalment to leap over! All in all, this will go down as one of the best book series I have consumed, and I look forward to reading the three books back-to-back. I look forward to what Amish will come up with next, considering the clear hint he drops about the "Mahabaratha". Bring it on...
A superb follow up to the last two books by Amish. For the fans of the trilogy it sure a mammoth piece of cake! As the fight against good and evil, Shiva fights against the ultimate evil...Imagine what Amish wrote and you sure will be in a heaven. No spoilers alert here but a sure shot recommendation for the readers!
I liked the story telling there is no much change in the style but it doesn't pull you towards the story line, while trying to show the anger during war there were few words put to emphasise the anger but doesn't seem justified in the book nor the story. It is by far the lousy of three.
its 565 pages of the world's greatest love story penned down. the book lives up to its long waiting period. love everything about it and i am on a total high after reading it which u cant after even smoking weed. Lord shiva , goddess sati , the unending pillars of pure love and the world around them truly mesmerisng. i am in a total new world to experience the blessings of my lord. i am speechless and spellbound. u should read the book to experience the blessings of the lord, nt from a skeptical point of view, that way u wont feel the true love , and emotion portrayed in the book
The way the story unfolds with twists and the way he connected it with the existing mythology was simply OUT OF THE WORLD!... There is the philosophy involved in every nook and corner of a story justifying both good and bad !....
Please donot buy this book online, I bought a copy from flipkart but a page of the book is torn. I guess they sell defective books at lesser prices than MRP. Otherwise the book is ok. If you want to buy books just go to a nearby store or try other sites.
A huge disappointment. Too many loose ends .... No justification to the characters that were created... Good things are the war strategies and some philosophical arguments.... Last 100 pages he lost the plot completely... No proper conclusion...Main character suddenly forgets whatever he preached in the last two books Still I feel his second book is far far better... and finally no justification to the title even
I just finished reading the book and I just have only one word.....mesmerizing :) This was an epic read and even now (while writing this review)..I'm still gripped with the story...and the awesome portrayed characters.. Those who haven't gone through the book yet, please make sure that you do go through the series...this is one such gripping tale..a new Mahabharata..
This is a great book....Waited a long time for this book,must read for everyone..This is a 600 pages Blockbuster Book...Amish Is the present best author of india..he has turned a mytholgical story into a awesome story....great read for all ages...
Thumbs up for the sales and service of flipkart.... No complaints :))) The book was not upto expectations..... maybe coz i had hoped it to be an indian "Return of the king" or " Deathly Hallows" ... but in itself the book is quite good except that at times it becomes too fantastic ....in fact that is the only con to this book ...
I got this book on the day of release at around noon. Though Flipkart had sent me an email a couple of days earlier saying it was already shipped they later sent another one requesting to ignore the last. Anyway, they sent it on time so I'm not complaining. The fact that Shiva used the daivi astra in the end was disappointing. Though the love of his life was taken from him, and the pain is indeed unbearable, there is no denying the fact that his using the nuclear weapon goes against his God status. It makes him no different from another man. Maybe, the author wanted to stress that. If you compare it with Rachel's death from Nolan's Batman trilogy, Wayne did not then attack the city of Gotham. Altogether though, this book is a good read like its predecessors.
Fastest delivery by flipkart.. received on 27 th feb .. around 4 pm While the plot seems interesting in beginning, it becomes less interesting in the ending.. The story is very descriptive and i have to say that Amish has done a lot of research and written this masterpiece.. Though longer than the previous two, the book is well written considering the different views of characters and superb plot.
I had a lot of expectations from this book having read the other 2 books multiple times. The book is much longer in comparison to the earlier books. The book captures your imagination right from the beginning and holds you in its spell right till the end. Yes, the book does get predictable at certain times and follows the Shiva and Sati story line that we know. However, Amish does a commendable job in capturing the emotions through out the book, which takes the book to a new height. Also, would like to appreciate the author for letting each character develop so well, especially since there are so many important characters in the story. This book ends the trilogy which has created tremendous fan following among the readers and would say that this book is a fitting end to it. Flipkart service was great as the book was delivered on 27th Feb itself, however I didn't receive a signed copy.
The 1st half of the book was a bit boring and a bit lengthy. It was like reading a lecture compilation. But the 2nd half was very good and the last few chapters made me cry. I personally liked the 2nd book from the trilogy series.
The third book is a good read but gets predictable at times, having said that, i complement the author for writing 3 books on mythological subject and making them a compelling read. Was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book and many thanks to Flipkart for the deliver on release date. T
Flipkart as always, delivered the best. I prebooked this in december and got the book on Feb27th the release date itself. Like the previous two books, this one is also very good and the language is pretty simple for those who don't read a lot like me. Since I have read the previous two books, this one took my mind into the story, from the first page itself. This one is a very good book for a trilogy. I can say its worth for the money i had paid.
I ordered the by feb 14th but haven't received anything till dat. When enquired with flipkart customer care all the say is have technical problems with tracking ID. They said it'll be set right in 24 hrs and I am still waiting for this. I didn't experience this anytime before.
I made the pre order of this book on the very day it was advertised on this website and it was mentioned that the book will be delivered with the Autograph of Amish (the author). But when I received this book there were no signatures. I had called the customer care and informed them about it. The executives said they will replace it with new book with autograph. So I waited for another two days and when I received this replaced book the result was still the same NO AUTOGRAPH. I again informed the call centre and this time they said we can't do anything about it and you can have your refund. This statement proved that the commitment level of these people sucks and its not worth buying books from this website.
Amish, I'm afraid I had great expectations from you for the conclusion of the epic. I feel that even if you had borrowed certain ideas from other books & plots, it would have been justified in order to give an epic conclusion to the story of one of the greatest Gods from the Hindu pantheon. The conclusion left me wanting more. Sorry but I know that you could have done better than this. It seems like you were under pressure to finish the book & gave it a hasty conclusion. :(
Flipkart service was awesome... i got the book on 27th afternoon.... i never expected that......Many did nt like the way the book ended.... but i loved it...... ****plot spoilers****author tried to make the story interesting without dragging the story away from the base plot- our mythology, culture and history. his description of battles were awesome especially Sati's final war. But i felt like either he lost the control of the plot somewhere in the or tried to push the plot from its natural course. One minor mistake i noticed (may be i am mistaken) is the reference to bhagavat gita by Gopal. This story happens long before mahabharatha yudha... ****plot spoilers**** The story remands us that Siva is also a human being but became a God through his actions. Also even he is prone to make mistakes...... I would like to discuss a lot more about the book. But this is not the right place and dont want to spoil the fun by reveling the plot. as the Protagonist says Everything that has a beginning, has an end Have fun reading......
Immortals of Meluha - 6/10 Secret of Nagas - 8/10 Oath of Vayuputras - 4/10 The first book was well written and slowly it began to interest me. The aftermath of the war and the climax were good and yes, the book was about the Meluhans. The second book builded upon the first explaining many things and connecting the dots. And the nagas played a very important role. And the book was almost perfect and I couldn't keep it down till I reached the end. The title was worth it and kept me waiting for the third. I had good expectations about the 3rd book but it was a complete letdown. The title indicates a very important role for the Vayuputras but it appeared like the author had difficulties fitting it in. Also the wars were explained too well in the 1st two books making them believable. Too many loose ends were there. Making the mahirishi a villain out of no where, his medicine which is better than somras, his mind reading tech, highly advanced vayuputras daivi astra tech which would b lost when a new tribe would come in. Trying to connect the story with the history made the plot too weak and things got out of hand, I would say. Overall a commendable just above average triology. But the second books proves the author's mettle and I hope he can come up with more better ones than the 3rd.
i have just finished reading it...thanx flipkart for delivering it precisely on 27th february. Now i will get to the point why i dont like it like its previous two books... while the author creating the lore from a different angle and and a new aspect...he just give the series a tragic angle killed Sati. which i find unrequired and troublesome to accept...i was not prepared for an "love story" or " i too had a love story " theme. and this is reason enough for me to not read it again any time soon...while i have read previous two books numerous times.
My pace of reading a book is inversely proportional to the quality of content, and I finished this book pretty quickly. There were several portions especially towards the later part of the book that I just skimmed through. The author has taken pains to do a lot of research, and the same shows in the discussions between Shiva and Gopal Pandit. However, the same not being a part of the narrative seems labored and not very interesting. Book's ending also is a bit disappointing, and am not sure about the author's intent to finish the book in this manner. Maybe it was to actually adhere to the concept of Shiva destroying the world after Sati's death. Or maybe because he delayed the book by more than 6 months and had to finish it somehow. The series feels incomplete with this ending. Standalone, this book is quite average. Overall, people who read the first two books and eagerly awaited this one (like my wife and mother-in-law), will buy it despite positive or negative reviews. If you have not read any, I will still strongly advise you to read the first and second books as the same are in a different league altogether.
Service from flipkart is aweosme. I received the book from flipkart on 27th day of its launch. I book is decent. May be I had high expectation because of very longer wait for the 3rd book of tiology. I felt the story was bit dragged in the first half of the book. But details of scene is just awesome. Anyway you cant avoid this if you had read the 1st two part of triology.
It is an absolutely well channeled blast of creativity turned into a book that can become an epic of modern times. The book reached a peak by the 45th chapter but immediately descends once the chapter finishes. The rhythm of the book is lost after this and thus leaves the character of Shiva in a dilemma rather than the god he already was. The ending cannot draw any positive remarks as it couldn't bring back the glory of reading that the first three fourth's of the book maintained. Yawning happened sometimes as Amish got more obsessed with detailing that he even covered 2 pages for detailing a scene, but still it is a binding read.The enthusiasm of 'what happens next' can make his reader to cover the 565 page book in a short time of two days. Any way Khudos to Amish as life's realities are made transparent with exceptionally wonderful Series of Books.
Amish has kept the Charm alive throughout the book. Finished reading and couldn't tell myself that the Trilogy ends here. All the characters portray inspiring roles through which a lot can be consumed. Neelakanth was shiva's destiny which he cannot escape. The peoples GOD. The story is well contained untill the end. All the pieces come into place in this part.
WMDs and Bawas feature in the last of the triology. Story drags in many places and peppered with stilted conversations and one dimensional characters. Amish is a hard worker but not adept in the art of story telling. After all the hype and OST etc ..a let down.
It shows the main difference between the evil and good. Flipkart's delivert was awesome. I have recieved it at 9 am on the release date. The wrath of shiva has been shown furiously and Love between Sati and Shiva was highlight. Myth has been equalled with the novel
Just spend 2 working days going through the 500++ pages . Amish my friend this was not your last book , you have have kept short and crisp. At times the language becomes as if George Gurdjieff was trying to awaken a social cause. Graham hancock was seen in spirt but his keenness for detail was missing. The polt losses it's track with the death of SATI . A option to write further book on what happened in Egypt was a late stage conception , it could have been built in a better format. Else a great book , I love the narrative , plot and the execution. Finally- your proof reader left a few spelling mistakes , hope you can rectify in the 2nd edition.
While the first book was amazing and the second one quite good, the last of the sequel sucks big time and is a huge letdown. It denigrates into a C-grade book with the author not knowing how to end it. Don't read this if you had liked the other two.
To begin with, extol to Flipkart for their super-fast delivery and i got the book on the same day of its official release and i was very happy. The book takes off from where "The secret of Nagas" ended. First two chapters are good and then slowly it starts pegging back your interests. Too much elaboration at times makes one to skip the entire paragraph and i feel these should have been watered down to keep one glued to the book. Secondly, this book has some loose ends and raises few questions. The main antagonist funks when he is on the verge of the defeat and this will not be way an antagonist will respond to his enemy. The Author's failed to support/justify the killing of innocents by the mahdev. Clearly, this is a let down by the Author after giving two good books...
Obviously this s the best book in the Shiva Trilogy!! Couldn't even put it down for a min.. Though the pace was a little slow in the beginning, it picked up speed in the middle.. Thank you so much flipkart for delivering on the release date as this is my first time reading a book on its release date.. The packing was as usual very good and I've already started recommending this to all my friends... Really very interesting book and thanks again for flipkart for the much reasonable price!! V. Shanmukha priya, Thanjavur.
I got this book on 28th, one day later than the release date. When i started reading the book, i just was not able to keep it down. I turned pages after pages and the suspense was building up so much that i turned to the last chapter and started reading it. I was halfway through the last chapter when i controlled myself and turned to the page i was previously on so that i may not lose the suspense and thrill in the upcoming chapters. Amish's books are just irresistible. I am now halfway through the book. A must read for everyone...
To start with i loved both previous books of this series and I was obviously having lot of expectation from this book... But now if i start counting problem with this one, list will be endless 1st of all length is too much... it gets too dull, too boring, too predictable in its plot... for 1st 200-250 pages there was literally nothing going on... every character is talking to other and so on... no major plot development... 2nd thing is author wanted to create epic... so everything is explained and dragged to a point where it becomes pointless... another thing is the revelation of greatest evil... it just doesn't fit anywhere and we are left wondering why a was has been fought on such an issue which can be dealt by simply talking.... there are numerous things to write on but only good thing about the novel are last 150-200 pages but for that you will have to suffer boredom for a seemingly infinite time... so if you haven't bought 1st two parts then avoid this...
Plot starts very slowly and in a bit fairy tale kind of way. It is a bit disappointing that they show every one on other side to be total idiots. Am i really expected to believe that two such great emperors are just incapable of simple military tactics! I also didnt like the Demigod portrayal of Sita, and few other minor things on to the positives, it is gripping, like its predecers. Have to read it in single sitting, and narration is excellent. It is normally very predictable, but tends to surprize when you least expect it. A good end, but not a great end to the series!!
i really dont think i need to tell you how the book is as you already know its awesome , infact everyone who like the other two books will know that its awesome . I got the book today and finished it in one single strech , again you know its worth the money :)
too excited to read the book. The verdict by my cousins - "Superlicious ".. Amish made ,me wait for long.. But i am damn sure it gonna rock. And so my rating as the REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 'DIDNT READ THE BOOK TILL NOW GUYS' will surely be 5 star.. Here goes...
What a book! The more you read the more fascinated you become. The twist and turns make you want to read on and never keep the book down. Finished reading it yesterday and was in a trance till along time after that. The ending was so sudden and so not-what-i-thought that it left me spellbound. The plot did stretch a little in the middle but maybe because i was imaptient to read the climax and what would happen ultimately. The ending made me sad as well. It was a massive 600 pages story but worth the read absolutely. If people already know the story of Shiva, then they won't be much surprised. Mythology always fascinates me and hence this book left me wanting for more. As for the Flipkart service, you guys rock!! I received the book on 27th morning prompt nicely packed. Thanks a ton!
Great service from Flipkart got the book on 27 around 11 am ..the book is good but found it to be not as good as the previous 2 books. But still is a must read for all Shiva Trilogy Fans BUT HAVING PRE ORDERED MUCH IN ADVANCE EXPECTED TO RECIVE A SIGNED COPY BUT INSTEAD RECEIVED AN ORDINARY COPY .......
The book kept me waiting for a long time, and when released, it was really worth the wait. The way Amish tells the story, you cant keep the book down till you are done reading. He captures the readers with his brilliant story telling ... A fitting end to what has been a wonderful journey for us, the readers. A Brilliant book. People who haven't read the trilogy, READ IT!!!
flipkart service is amazing got the book on release date tats cool but the book is not!! diassapointed with amish alot!! he just over exaggerated things!! FUSION WEAPON @ the end tats looks kind of epic but not really!! its like he has written a script for an hollywood movie climax!! 1st & 2nd books were convincing but not this one! its slow!! too unbelievable its like iam reading a religious book on shivas adventure!! its like an ancient worldwar with india, persia and egypt involved!! shiva was just a man in the first 2 books but amish made him bruce willis in the final one!
I am a rook when it comes to reading so I will keep my review short. The book is fantastic. A bit dry in the middle but all in all it manages to keep you glued to the book. Though somewhere I feel the end was disappointing compared to the built up by the earlier 2 books. But that's really not a big deal,you are still going to love it. The depiction of Shiva as a mortal is fantastic. Flipkart's service was exceptional and on time. The book was in perfect shape.
Nothing to write much, since everyone else have submitted their valuable reviews.. But all I can say that I am truly satisfied with Flipkart's service. The book is worth read. Though the book lacks the fire compared to the first two of the series, but thats only a personal comment. At the end the story would catch your breath and might bring you to tears... Worth read.... Amish did it again...
First things first, thank you flipkart for the excellent delivery - the book was delivered to my hands by 9:30AM on the 27th. And No Thanks Mr. Karan Johar for ruining possibly one of the best epic Indian novels. A substantial let down this one. The first book started off choppy but picked up and ended well; the second one was really good all through. But after building up the hopes and expectations, am really disappointed with the way the third book has turned up. To give the due credit, the plot is not bad (which in itself is a downer as you expect nothing short of awesome for the conclusion) but the way the plot unfolds is written in a amateurish way. The author built the character of the protagonist through two books in such a way that Shiva is what everybody desires to be but is afraid to be - the embodiment of righteousness, courage and truth - and suddenly takes almost a U turn to favor a cliched, melodramatic and filmy ending, in the process tarnishing the character itself. Mr. Amish, were you already thinking about the production constraints and public acceptance for huge initial collections of the movie while writing this book? Agreed you can take a few liberties and talk about rocket science and nuclear physics during 1900BC but why would you want to go on and on and on about some boring and mind-numbing battle tactics for relatively inconsequential clashes? Anyway, thank you Mr.Author for giving an interesting epic trilogy and no thank you for ending it on such a sorrily meek tone.
Was waiting for the book to release for a long time. And finally on 27th feb i got my copy. Really love the way the author Amish describers Shiva. Really hope now that the author starts with new trilogy series. Want to read more...
There was a lot expected from the last of the trilogy since Amish has to beat his own benchmark set by his previous books. Though the story keeps you glued, it does not keep you on the edge all the time and also becomes too simplistic at times. It stops short of what could have been another masterpiece. I would not give much away in the review and would let the other readers explore this sequal.
If you have read first two parts, there is no reason why should somebody miss the third one. Don't read the reviews. Most of them have spoilers and that too without warning. Flipkart delivered it on the same day of release. Good work Flipkart
First... thanx to flipkart for the best service... i have receiving mails and msgs on the delivery n i got it on the date n tym exactly as mentioned by them... On the book... it is not an easy task to bring geography, myth and philosophy together and use your own imagination, to entertain us for 600 pages. As for a reader like me, books on these subjects, jus make me yawn. Handling facts and fiction together is a tedious task. Hats off to Amish. Its a psychological fact that when your expectations are so high, no matter how good the product is, you will never feel satisfied. Amish is jus another human like u and me, and it is not practically possible to surpass the huge amount of expectations bestowed on him, he has given his best and yes this is the right end for this trilogy is wat i feel. i was really stuck to the book in the first few chapters on how Amish was taking the plot, explaining wats GOOD and EVIL. This book is a page turner. The bottomline - The Oath Of Vayuputras - "its Entertainment guaranteed"
This book was delivered on the 27th and Flipkart has by far the best delivery system. Keep it up. As for the Book, it is a very very good read. The basic plot of the finale is set from the very beginning, and hardly any mysteries are kept for the blockbuster ending. The credible job done by the author inspite of laying down his cards bare from the very start is truly laudatory. The ending is moving and the Epilogue does justice to the Legend of Shiv as we know it. No strings are left unattended, a book well writen. Amish deserves his praises. The subtle hint for the topic of his next is also the ending of his book. Well done.
Haven't yet started reading the book ... But really Impressed with the delivery of Flipkart guys .. Got my copy within 25 Hours of ordering this book .. that also in 'not so big' city like Jamnagar .. .. A big thumbs up from my side to the delivery guys .. Hope the book is as good as the earlier parts ..
Amish rockzzz As expected fantastic book ..very good book beautiful screen ..plot,,,overall great 1000/1000. Flipkart's delivery was also good .I got book in no time. In the book cover the illustration of the pics "dhanu' and the 3-d view on the cover really mind blowing .I will personally recommend all readers to take the taste of this fantastic idea and to get the fragnance of real talent .
At nearly 600 pages, The Oath of the Vayuputras is a massive book. Yet it has a good flow, which enables readers to finish it quite soon. I do not wish to reveal too much of the plot (although some other reviewers have already done that here!), but as the blurb says, Shiva is preparing his forces to battle the Evil, and at one desperate point, turns to the tribe of the Vayuputras, who help him defeat the Evil. It's the classic Good vs Evil tale, with the author trying to pack in as many details as possible about the (semi) fictional world he's created, and trying to fill in some of the gaps left by the previous two books. There is "bloodshed", and a lot of it, and the chapters detailing the numerous battles are seemingly well written, with chapter number 45 being the best of them all. Do not expect any heavy twists though; in the end, this is quite ordinary fare. If you already know the tale of Lord Shiva, you won't be surprised at how the story progresses and ends. Even so, the book provides quite a satisfying experience. All that said, there are more loopholes in Book 3 compared to the previous two books, and given its length, the plot gets a bit slow in some parts. Also, the writing is not entirely convincing, sometimes just skipping ahead of important conversations and scenes. Definitely read it, but do not expect a masterpiece! And finally, I would like to request other reviewers not to include spoilers in their reviews! I was just looking at a few reviews on this page and was surprised to find too many spoilers; that takes out the fun out of reading the book.
It is a perfect book ..... a perfect ending and tells the story that has become a legend. While it is fiction, it is believable entirely. Will not reveal the plot since its just been released, itâ€™s a wonderful work.. well done Amish.. hats offâ€¦. this is the first impression... which is often said is also the last.......
Done with Vayuputras. As I said earlier about the series, the books are good and intelligent fantasy, not up right there with Harry Potters and LOTRs but really good nonetheless... What makes it more special is that it is totally indigenous, for the readers have grown up reading stories and myths about these characters, and seeing them get a realistic twist makes it even more intriguing... The story is good, not too many twists in this one in contrast to the last 2 books... The end does seem a bit anticlimactic but the finale provides closure to the reader, closing some of the loopholes and telling us briefly about the final fates of the major characters... Amish Tripathi gives a quick peek into what may become his next venture, a gritty reboot of Mahabharat... After this trilogy, my expectations are indeed high.. It would be interesting to see his treatment of characters as complex as Krishna, Duryodhan and Arjun... And on that note, a word about the characters... Amish delivers some brilliantly crafted characters this time, Parvateshwar's moral dillema and Daksha's motivations made me sit right up... All in all, I give this a book a 3.5 (The 5s are the Harry Potter series, so you can have a yardstick)...
I got the book at 8 am on 27th - thats just wow !! Cant say the same for the book though, bit of a let down compared to the first two. The start seems promosing with the good vs evil and what is evil bit, but somewhere there too much of confusion as it reaches the end.
Got the book 10.00 Am in the morning, The plot seemed to nice and quick, war tactics was well explained and very griping, but at the end the entire story seems to fall apart.. Sati's death was not justified.. and role of Vayputhra's and Maharishi Brigu's is a serious let down...
Amish is an enthralling writer who mixes history, mythology and fiction like no other. An extremely well written book, but lacks in enchantment like the first two. The author has tried to inculcate the mainstream story of Lord Shiva and Goddess Sati from our mythology and portray it in a human way in the third novel as well. But somehow due to certain elements, circumstances and situations, he has wavered towards the finish, hence creating a not so great end to a hugely immersive series. Another well written book overall with an extremely strong beginning and a battle ridden journey, but a weak ending. All characters are beautifully written and each one gets its space in the story, which is very essential. If the writer was adopting the author's license of creating his own world then he should have touched upon the sensitive issues of the story like Sati and Devagiri in a more settling manner. After all we already know the story of Lord Shiva and Goddess Sati, it should have been a bit deviating. Overall 3 cheers to Amish Tripathi, could have been much better though... And 5 cheers to Flipkart for another timely express delivery.
First , Kudos to the Flipkart team. The book was delivered as promised.. When the announcement of book release was made, the book was on the way to be delivered to me. Wow ! I got the book in my hand as the announce was being made. The book is an excellent sequel to the other two and keeps up the pace till the end !! You will not repent every second of it. The Good Vs Evil has been depicted very well. Not only a novel, you are left to do a self-analysis to check if you are Good or Evil. Read the book to immense, acquire a deep knowledge and enjoy it as well ! Happy reading !
I am waiting to have this book launched since a year, and when flipkart offered pre booking, I promptly opted for it [On 24th Dec 12 to be more specific]. Since the book is launched and many of the users got it on the day of launch from flipkart. My book is still not shipped till date [28-feb-13] and status is showing -"Will be shipped once released" I am nothing to have to review for this book but for flipkart delivery..this time it sucks!!! giving star is important.. so not for the book, but delivery u guys deserved 0 star.. Bad Bad Bad experience this time...
Kudos to the Flipkart for delivering the book on the Releasing Date itself..As expected the book turned out to be as awesome as its predecessors. The narration & the plot were equally awesome. The book kept me glued till the end and i didn't even felt the urge to eat or drink till the end....Excellent work by Amish Tripathi!!!!!!!
I like to thank Flipi (Flipkart) for the always dot on time delivery of the goods purchased from them. even my book Oath of the Vayuputras. Unfortunately i have had so little to read only a couple of chapters but it is still captivating as ever. Amish is a truly gifted writer. The part 3 here I would say was not that gripping as the previous 2 parts but none the less a good read. The pace is good and the battles are nicely described. Overall a satisfying ending which leaves you with a calm and serene environment.
The book was a complete package comprising of emotions, action, philosophies, morals and etiquette among others. Although the book did make one yawn at times because of the expansive description of surroundings leaving not even a minuscule detail for the user to paint in his mind. The end also was somewhat not synonymous to the build-up via the other books and left the reader wanting for a better or rather epic conclusion. The author also seemed quite intent on exaggerating the prowess and abilities of some of the main characters making it hard to gulp down the throat. All in all the book is totally worth a read although reading it once again would certainly be an uphill task. All said and done amish needs to be praised for bringing in such a unique concept of making the immortal a normal human being and showing an extremely interesting side of this parallel transformation. It's very difficult to write a book and even so on one of the most worshiped god without hurting anyone's religious sentiments. Therefore kudos to amish for doing it and hope you come up with your new venture soon. The book reached me at 12:00 on the 27th so certainly full marks to the flipkart services.
I have preordered this book 25 days ago...The preorder page mentioned the preordering customers gets the book signed by the author...But there was a big NO for this....there is no point in prordering the book if it is not a signed copy... ..I am terribly upset with flipkart this time....in this front...but the delivery was good as always
Great story retold in a different way also unbiased towards other beliefs(Vaishnavas & Shaaktas majorly); Given equal importance to Sruti, Smruti and Agama. A great blend of story. Some set backs are definitely there; but only when you see the content in parity with actual purans and Shivaagamas. But if you see this as a story inspired by them; Its just awesome tale told by Amish. Kudos to flipkart delivery.
This time it is really bad service from Flipkart, it was suppose to be delivered yesterday. When I called up the customer service they have informed me that due to delivery overload, they was not able to delivery yesterday. Flipkart should have anticipated the same and should have increased the courier service,so that customers are not suffered. The customer service have indicated that they will try to deliver it today, and that is also not confirmed. what is the use of pre-odering the book, when it cannot be delivered on time. This is the second time, I am facing this issue with Flipkart, where the delivery of the ordered products was not on time.
Got my copy yesterday....but its not signed as promised by flipkart... :( But nevz cant stop reading.....As ususal amish has done a great job...the plot n characters are such that u cant stop thinking about book when you have other mundane things to do...oh i am gonna hate my job till i complete this book.....Two thumbs up for " the oaths of vayuputras"..........
Really pleased with the delivery of flipkart ! :D Awesome :D Kudos to the team ! Although a bit disappointed that couldnt get the authors signed copy ! :( Cant wait to start reading the book :D Hopefully it should live up to the expectation !
First of all thanx a ton to flipkart. i never expected that i'll get the most awaited SHIVA TRIOLOGY 3 on its publication date.. The service by flipkart deserves a 5 star plus a 1/2 star for its superb delivery. The ease in placing the order makes any customer to attract towards flipkart Reading the Book, the fantastic lines written by Mr. Amish... Hats Off to you sir.... this fiction changed my thinking of our Hindu Mythology from every direction and to work on it... it creates the magic..... *****1/2 will not sleep till the end...... OM NAMAH SHIVAY!!!
I was waiting for the book to get delivered on 27th Feb 2013. Not satisfied this time with the delivery schedule. I had specifically pre ordered the book since i wanted to be one of the first reviewer of this amazing trilogy. I hope they deliver it on 28th Feb.
Well, it's a win win situation. i just completed the ' The Secrets of Nagas' today only and got the delivery today thanx to flipkart for it. Yeah sure its a promising book by Amish cuz it seems gud, i have manged to read only 130 pages but they are good as far esp. the return of Brhaspati
Received book today as promised, I thought we would get signed copies by Author but anyway hope to see if flipkart provides such services. I have just started reading book hope to see this book also creates similar excitement the way it did in earlier books. All the Best Amish Tripathi..
Just love flipkart for its dellivery promptness Already half way through and haven't left my bed since I got the book Its crazy exciting Nearly perfect writing Splendid narration Would make a great movie Amazing book Amish....Take a bow man....u deserve it thanks for bringing alive Hindu mythology in such a manner you have churned it into a fantastic book
Well, I have read all the three books in the Shiva Trilogy in the past 5 days - never even peeked at one before. I found the plot building up nicely and many questions were left open and subsequently answered. Might as well say I pretty much liked the first two - can't say the same for the third. I finished reading it in around 5 hours - looked promising in the beginning. But the plot seems to have lost its way somewhere and I find myself in some khichdi at the end. The Vayuputras had a very minor role in the whole story (the whole trip to Pariha seemed to be forcibly squeezed in) - and the author seems to have gone out of his way to justify the title given to Kartik (God of War). Wiping out seventy thousand soldiers while losing only five thousand - too much exaggeration. Shiva losing his cool and using the daivi astra - was just way uncool. Even with continuous references and reminders to "Anger is your enemy", he was still consumed by it. I wonder why the teachings of Manobhu bore no relevance in the end. And well, I really don't have anything against main characters being killed in a novel as long as the subsequent events justify it - Sati's death was not. I was left with more questions that I had at the beginning. The biggest was about Bhrigu - the portrayal of his character was a total mess in my opinion. I really had no idea what to think about him - after all the hype, "a man whose name instils dread in the fiercest of warriors". Also, Bhrigu gave some medicines to Dilipa which were even more powerful than Somras to restore his health. Going by the logic propagated, wouldn't that itself be a bigger threat than Somras at some time? The implications seem to be completely forgotten. And with the formation on the Lhasans, the secret of the Vayuputras (the daivi astras) is going to be lost or what? Shouldn't all the secrets be protected together rather than each Mahadev coming and forming his own tribe which will preserve one such secret, while abandoning everything else from the past? There were too many gaping holes in the plot. The concluding book is supposed to resolve the confusion, not propagate it further! I did manage to finish it quite quickly, but it was a letdown for me - or maybe I just had unrealistic expectations.
i started reading this book at 10:00 and have finished it at 9:00................... BOOK IS AWSOME THNX AMISH............................................... BEST BOOK..........................................................................................
Flipkart i love u. i pre-ordered the book and it was delivered around 10:00 in the morning as far as the book is concerned the book is indeed awesome!! Amish's touch of action gripped mystery makes u feel that u have witnessed the destruction of evil in the mystical land of meluha...
I was smitten to the concept of Amish Tripathi when Immortals of Meluha was released. I was mesmerized by the Secret of Nagas and this book is totally captivating. When flipkart started taking pre-orders of this book I took it that I will do a pre-order and to my great satisfaction Flipkart delivered it true to word on the date of the launch. I have just gone through first three chapters and it is a fully engrossing. Looks like I have a long night ahead as I may not be able to sleep till I completely read this book. Great work Amish and keep up the good work Flipkart.
It was 8.30 in the morning of 27th Feb, the doorbell rung and with my utter surprise I saw my long waited book has come. Though it is not the author signed copy, I believe the author will thrill us as usual with his penmanship. Cheers to Flipkart.
Didn't expect flipkart to deliver the book today. After all, it released today! Digged into it right now. As engrossing as the first two parts. Can't keep away. Little disappointed that I didn't get the signed copy. But like many other reviews, I guess nobody received a signed copy at all. Sad, but true. Anyway, Amish Tripathi has done a brilliant job. Brilliant, brilliant job. Loving it. And yes, Thank you Flipkart. Great service.
Got the book in afternoon at 3'o clock. Never expected such a prompt delivery. Awesome service by Flipkart. Maza aa gaya!!! Read few chapters till now & book is already gripping. Hope end will be good too. Har Har Mahadev!!!
You guys deserves kudo's for your service standards. Best in India. Neat Packaging. Always get Delivered till my security desk in an IT park. (My other experience has been going outside to collect my stuff, which is time consuming and pain). Quick Delivery.
Hey everyone did anyone of you who pre-order the book received a signed copy of the vayuputras? Anyways I got the vayuputras today at around 2.30. And am still reading it. So if anyone received a signed copy of the book please write in your review.
I was eagerly wating for the book from the morning. Constantly checking the order status. Finally i received the book... With a surprise.... Yes.. a personally signed copy.. :) Cant wait to start reading even though i am at work... will post my review once i complete..
WoW, got this book delivered on the 27th of February itself. thanks to flipkart, i knew you wouldn't disappoint. . . . and the book says over a million copies sold already. I haven't finished the book yet but as far as i have read the book sure is addictive. Great job by the author and best wishes for his next endeavor. will definitely wait for that. good job flipkart team
Recieved it today.. Thank you Flipkart for delivering the book on the day of its Release. Shiva Trilogy is My favourite book series and have loved the previous two books. Dying to start reading :) Will write detailed review once I finish..
Got it just now. Not signed, but who cares??? The book is like the signature! The delivery was first class and I didn't have to walk all the way to a store. I'm so jumpy, I can't write anymore...................................... I have to read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I pre ordered the book as soon as I got the news that it was up for pre order. Initially the time mentioned was March. But later i got the news that 27th feb would be the launch date. It's 27th 2 pm and I already have the book . The book is in pristine condition. I am a book worm and hate if my books r nt in good shape. So thanks a lot for proper package. Amazingly superfast service. Keep up the good work . This is what makes me come back to Flipkart every time i think of online shopping.
Recieved the book on time - kudos to Flipkart for on time delivery !!! Have started the book ..it appears to be everything as promised. worth the long wait ! To read this trilogy one needs to suspend the beliefs of Shiva as the ultimate God. You need to view him as Shiva the warrior - the Avtar - who ascends to become God Many thanks for Amish for taking us through this wonderous journey ---
Committed delivery on 27th, recieved it. Perfect . Totally happy and appreciative. Not a signed copy as expected. Yes, you said "Win a signed copy ".. As per mail I received from flipkart, it said " Pre-order your copy of The Oath Of The Vayuputras now and you can win an exclusive author signed copy of the book" . I pre-ordered on same day. No criteria was mentioned on any condition/contest/lucky dip/first come/ etc to receive the signed copy. I called the customer care. The guy says I didnt qualify for the signed copy, as I didnt meet the criteria. Asked him what that was, and he has no clue. Kept me on hold for a while and said, may be it was for the first 100 customers only. Im surprised and feeling let down by the service for the first time. Pls be clear on your communication , through promo mails and call centre on what is in and what is not.
How many can write the story of God without the the God element in it??? Shiva is fervently worshipped by almost a Billion, Amish Tripathi brings this Trilogy without the usual Godly grandeur and that his greatest strength... His story telling goes through simple storytelling without usual abracadabra... I was forced to start reading Meluha and in a week I was finished with Nagas too... The Oath of Vayaputras will be a Good Book because he knows how to tell an age old story in a new and mysterious way!!!
Well firstly great job flipkart. When I pre-ordered Secret of the Nagas, i got the book on the next day of the release but this time I got the book delivered at 10:30am on the date of release. Have been waiting for this book since last few months. Have read five chapters till now and the story seems to have a good grip as the previous two books. All the best to all the readers. Har Har Mahadev!
The wait of finally over and I have the book in my hand. I am so impressed with Flipkart- the book released today and I have it on my desk....not waiting anymore to start Fabulous- keep it goin!! Its an original book with frescoes on the cover page and beautiful pages. Enjoy!!
Promises Delivered - the first time, and everytime !! I Pre-Ordered 'The Oath of the Vayuputras' and was waiting to see if Flipkart is able to keep up the promise it would have made to thousands of people :) So eager to read the book. Hoping it would be as exciting as the Meluha and Nagas books. Thank You, Flipkart. You never let us down any day.
Not review actually...but thankin flipkart for making me one of the very 1st buyers of this book...am waiting for Dan Brown's INFERNO next. Anyhoe pretty eager to read the book as soon as I find the time for doing so.
It was a lazy day and suddenly I got a call from flipkart. And I jumped out of my seat and rushed. I got it sharp 10.30 AM. And as expected that guy was carrying more than 100 copies of that book. I was happy when he told that I am the first person to whom he is delivering that book. SuperLikes to FlipKart for this. In the name of holy lake, I never expected that I'll get this today. Same day when its gonna released. Starting the book!!! Going on a 600 page long journey with Shiva. HAR HAR MAHADEV!
I had per-ordered this book but hadn't expected Flipkart to deliver it so soon!! Got the book just now n will start off now.. The first two books were just excellent and I hope the ending is just as gripping! Will update review once I finish the book..
I pre Ordered the book and got the book by 9.30 AM today - now, that is super-fast delivery. I have immensely enjoyed the first two parts and the first part of this book continues the same way - I am loving it! Will update with a full review once I manage to finish reading the book fully. I am slightly sad that I did not win one of those Author Signed copies.
I downloaded the complete eBook on my mobile just now. Feels great to be among the first ones to get their hands on this book, while some of my other friends continue to wait till tomorrow morning to buy it from their nearest bookstore. Completed the first chapter. The book is definitely worth the wait.
Just downloaded the ebook. Never thought it would be this fast. I loved the first 2 books in the trilogy and can't wait to finish this one. .
