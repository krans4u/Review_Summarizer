Surely You're Joking Mrx Feynman@@@I'd already read this book some 6 years back from library. i've a soft copy too (that also i've read several times). Was waiting for its price to go down and bought this book to put in my collection. i'm an avid reader but writing review for the first time because cudn't resist. generally i prefer people making their own opinion about a book but this book is something, I bet, nobody can find lesser than BEST. most importantly its not genre specific. it cant be categorized, its at the interface of fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography, science, philosophy, lifestyle and what not. I'm sure anybody (and anybody means ANYBODY) who starts reading this book can/will do anything (u wont even go to pee) before finishing it.
I had heard about Dr Feynman's incredible way of teaching using humorous way. This book is an absolute master piece. I would advice everyone to read it. The cost of the book is really peanuts for the priceless knowledge shared about Prof Feynman.
A very nice compiled volume full of witty anecdotes and experiences of one of the most famous physicists in history. His talks titled: Feynman's Lectures in Physics are very famous. Narrated in a matter-of-fact way, very enjoyable and in an easy way. Very good read.
The book describes the adventures of Mr. Feynman. It narrate the various instants happen in Feynman life.
Hard to put down. Feynman's life was filled with really interesting experiences and the way the book is written makes it a joy ride. Recommend it to anybody who want to read any genre.
Re-reading this book again. A very funny and witty account of Feynmaans life. You will be surprised to see that some of the things Feynmaan did ; would have been done by you too at some point in your life. Books such as this inspire you too pen down your own memoir, could even include the daily mundane things you do; cause sometimes magic resides in the everyday things we tend to ignore.
Being an insight into one of the brightest minds, this book will make you laugh and wonder at the same time. Delivery was quite prompt, no issues there. All in all a win-win situation for everybody.
Surely you're joking is a snippet account of the life of Prof. Feynman. There is so much to learn from his simple experiences of childhood brimming with frivolous experiments to his great achievements sprinkled across the book casually. All delivered with great humility. I found my connection in the fact that I too have been curious over science and physical phenomenon right through childhood, and it is SO IMPORTANT never to let that die. Over time, as Prof. Feynman grew up, he devised methods to protect this curiosity as he dealt with people who were resistant to change and questions seeking pure understanding. That to me, was the biggest take away; as it is this unfortunate resistance that plaques a large section of our society. A great, leisure science read with delightful insights into the great man's thought process!
An excellent book on the adventures and misadventures of one of the greatest scientists of the yesteryears, who, as mentioned in this book, was also a safe cracker, a bar goer, a skeptic, with endless curiosity, a jovial guy, a genius, and ..ooh i am running short of words. I must say, a very 'feyn' book. Go for it.
Overpowering & awesome. Enjoyed reading about one of the greatest Theoretical Physicist of 20th century...written eloquently in his own lively way. He expressed his life inside out.
Ralph Leighton has managed to perform a great service to humanity and bookworms who swear by the good stuff they lap it up! The genius of Feynman is captured in this petite book and one is only left asking for more (I mean those who actually wondered if they could be in the business of thinking and raising questions)! This is one book that makes me proud 'I have read through and through' (sometimes thrice, don't giggle the works of picking the lock is a little difficult to follow for slow people like me hehe !')
Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winning physicist was one of the most awesome scientists you'll ever know about. In this book, Richard Feynman tells (actually compiled by Leighton) various anecdotes and experiences of his life, inspiring you to think about mathematics and science in a different way. You can just learn a formula and an equation. But it is useless if you don't understand it intuitively and practically. Wish I read it when I was back in the school.... All that Mathematics would seem a lot different.
Richard feynmann is a f*&$ing genius. People with brains like him come across only once or twice in a lifetime. This is a brilliant book about stories of his life. Definitely worth a read. No wonder we call him the father of quantum physics and no wonder he won a nobel prize for physics and worked in the manhattan project to produce the atomic bomb in 1945
Quintessential Richard Phillips Feynman! An insight into the life of Feynman , and his genius An amazing read, not a Physics reference book. An excellent light read for anyone and everyone. Delivery right on time.
An important thing to remember is that this guy is not a professional writer. Within those limits, this is a really nice book; Feynman's level of thinking is so high that most of us cannot even imagine thinking at that level. The pieces relating to his love life are touching and nice to read, and the book shows you the quirkiness of the man, which is very important because it shows that Feynman is human after all!
This is one of the most inspiring book I have read. This is a story of gentleman who thought in a way no one had done before. In this book he takes us through his journey of life and anecdotes. Each story helps you figure out what one has to learn from him and how he could think clearly that no one could.
One of the books which tell how to look at science.Witty yet wriiten with great depth,every science student should go through the last chapter(commencement to Caltech) at least.This book is truly inspiring.
This man has just proved that a brilliant (understatement) scientist need not be a typical sheepish, timid, nerdy person. Who picks locks to master the skill??? Yeah right it is Mr. Feynmann... He makes you feel good and crappy at the same time. :D
Richard Feynman was a genius. As if being one of the leading theoretical scientists wasn't enough, he was also extremely versatile and extremely witty. This book is a great insight into the life of a person who showed that to be successful at what you do, you don't need to be single-minded, but can be interested in a million other things as well. Definitely recommended for anyone who has a passing interest in Science, although most of the things he has written about are non-scientific in nature Flipkart delivered it to me in Mumbai in 1 day - great service and a great discount as well!
This book gives you a deep insight of genius. Really, Feynmann was a magician! You are surprised at every page after knowing his adventures. Truly, he left no room to believe that he was not a "TRUE SCIENCE MAGICIAN". Really, the book in my hand delivered to me by flipkart.com is a "MASTERPIECE" indeed!
When I picked this book, I thought I would get a sneak-peek into the nerdy scientists lives. But I just realized that not all scientists are nerdy. Mr. Feynman was not only a great scientist. He was multi-faceted. As you go through the chapters of the book , you realize how witty, humorous, sarcastic and funny he was. I believe he has tried almost everything in life. Music, Drummer, Breaking locks, teaching..Gosh!!This man was super awesome one can only wish to be. He even tricked Einstein's assistant. Surely a page turner till the end.Even the philosophy in the book is interesting..A light read and totally worth reading for all the fun it comprises.
Well Mr. Abhi, first of all you need to know that this book is not supposed be a popular science book. It is simply the stories of Feynman's life. And second of all, from your writing it is quite clear that you don't know or haven't read anything else about Feynman (if you have then its even worse). So keep those dumb opinions to yourself.
Even for a non science person like me who knows barely anything about physics, this book has been fascinating to say the least. Feynman was a remarkable character for his day and the passion and fun he brought to his work has no parallels. Reminds me of Aamir Khan in 3 idiots... All in all a highly enjoyable book, goes to show that genius scientists are human too and not infallible or boring as they are made out to be Frank, honest, funny, no emotional/dramatic stuff and yet appealing so much to the reader for his humility and playing down the genius in him, read this book to know more about scientists
To be precise to the point.. It will be a much more great and exciting read for people who have some curiosity about scientists and their way of life.. There is very little actual science spoken about.. And the book is full of amusing and diverse experiences that Mr. Feynman has encountered in his scientific career and in his life.. Verdict : Thoroughly Enjoyable
This book will bust your myths about physicists being people with their head perpetually up in the clouds. They are human beings with frailties and emotions just like everyone else. He's a genius alright; but unlike Einstein, Feynman doesn't have the aura of the wise-old-man about him -- which is probably a shame...I wouldn't say he's a philosopher (since he thinks they're "tourists"), but he certainly appears to have turned wiser in his old age. But hey, this book is about his adventures as a young man. Highly recommended; guaranteed to give you many hours of pleasurable reading.
This book lets us take a peek at the remarkable,interesting and sometimes downright funny episodes in the life of the Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. Told in his own words, on topics as varied as the nuclear bomb to tips on picking up girls, the book keeps you enthralled to the end.
