THE ROZABAL LINE@@@Though I came to know about the book, that it is one of the good books to give a read. The book travels from time to time, introduces new characters very hard to remember the names. We hardly understand what the character's doing.......I read the other two books of Sanghvi, The Krishna Key and The Chanakya's Chant. Both were amazing. Thought the first one would be even Better, but the book is boring....I read only 20 papers, cannot move further due to the confusion it creates....I thought the book will be gripping. But NA..........I wouldn't recommend it for beginner's who are starting their Novel journey...
Well, I picked up this book with great enthusiasm. Authors keeps moving from one stage of history to another, although its great work of fiction as to how he has managed to thread all those pieces into a story.Somewhere down the line, I left this as overdone as well.
This is surely one of the best by Ashwin. The language and the depiction may not be mindblowing but it is definitely a good read
Sanghi exceeds Dan Brown in every aspect. Great interconnection of dots Very addictive, Finished it in just 3 days.....!
Ashwin Sanghi has tried to add too much content and story line to a small book resulting in too much and unwarranted twists and suspense. Too many characters make it difficult in the beginning made it difficult to identify the lead character in the story. This book is better than Krishna Key but is not as well thought out as the Chanakya's Chant
I din exactly like the book but yeah worth a read. Ashwin sanghi's first book. Leads through all ages from 3000 BC to 2012 AD
I happen to be a big Dan Brown fan and was looking for some good conspiracy novels, i came across Ashwin Sanghi, ordered his whole collection and concluded the Rozabal Line is too inspired by Dan Brown's works. Now it isn't a bad thing to be inspired, but an author should keep his/her distance from the original. Sadly, Ashwin Sanghi fails at that. So it was kinda repetitive read for me. As for Flipkart, as usual good delivery.
Un- researched, non- sensical... wonder why it gets such good reviews. Advice- PLEASE DO NOT READ IT .
I fully respect the skills of the writer for extensive and brilliant research on the various topics. The imagination and fictional skill to hitherto connect the life and Jesus with every religion in the world. But the story is too full of facts. It sometimes seems as if the writer was not able to understand how much information to give and fit in the story. Mid book it seems as if you are reading an encyclopedia. I got bored and thought of leaving it mid way. But just to understand how the writer comes to an end with all this mess i continued. The conclusion was also a mess. I don't recommend it for reading.
Too much of violence. You don't understand much until you have finished 50 percent of the book. Everything make sense towards the end. Climax is quite disappointing
great fiction yet filled with information about the religions.. recommended!! the theological thriller is nicely studied and reference list is made by the author for your reference. good source of info.
Must Read Recommended for every fiction lover, mixture of history and mystery, you will love the way you goes in and out of the history to present and then back to the history In last you will end up searching internet for the reality.
Mr. Ashwin Sanghi's books remind me of Mr. Dan Brown's books... Amazing plot... Filled with information and history ... This book makes u think of religions tht we are part of in today's world... It's a gripping book... Tough my fav book from this author is Chankaya Chant!
Ashwin Sanghi is the Dan Brown of India.. Its a gripping thriller, with a lot of religious references and conspiracy theories. A fun read
A DanBrown style novel by indian author Ashwin is fast paced and travels through various timelines and geographic locations.. Theological in nature, it brings to light many conspirational religious facts..a good novel to read and enjoy.
Average book. This is the first time I read Ashwin Sanghi - Seems many ideas have been picked from Da Vinci Code.
Dan Brown has a link with Ashwini Sanghi..!!! If u like thriller suspence nd mythology with adventure.. This book is Pandora's box.. Must read it.. waiting for other works of Ashwini Sanghii
The story is too confusing.. it jumps across centuries within 2 to 3 pages and to different countries.. there is no single thread which keeps you interesting.. in bits and pieces the history might keep you engaged.. but that also becomes boring after a certain point.. totally waste of money..
...especially after reading Chanakya's Chant - neither the story line is as gripping nor the narration.
flipkart's delivery is the best.. received in a day.. surely Dan Brown has an Indian contender.. fast paced and gripping.. A bit boring in some chapters but overall a great book. It will refresh and make u think of BOM JESUS.... U may feel it conspiring but it may be true...
The kind of research work went into this work is amazing. Its striking a perfect balance between facts & fiction. The narrative style is second to none. Ashwin Sanghi Rocks!!! Ofcourse FLIPKART is always the best....be it pricing, be it packing or the delivery of the product.
Its fast paced but moves too much around centuries. Needs too much concentration to read and understand the plot.
For a debut this book can be considered as "ok" , thats it. The author seems to be proving himself "erudite" . Some might say that this book can be equated with the Dan Brown saga..... people please come back to your senses. There is just too much information being thrown at your way and to top it , not in a nice way at all. There is a lot of repetition, making it predictable and boring at a lot of places. The emotional quotient is absolutely lacking, and where ever there is some it has been written badly. All i can say is Chanakya's Chant is a much better , readable and enjoyable book than this one.... Even if u do not have anything else to do....... think twice before reading this.
Amazing!!! Salute to the thought process of the writer while writing the book. The day you start reading this book...you will forget anything else is important to you.
story is too boring it tells too many stories that i think didnt link to each other makes one confuse while reading
very confusing!! the story is very complicated ...dont waste your money...buy something else ashwin sanghi's chanakya chant is much better
The book is written on a nice pace at the start, but the different stories have been mixed in a very wierd way ! At the start the Book engrosses you but somewhere in the middle it just becaomes a big drag ! the end is good but you become very bored reaching the end, unless you are interested in the stories related to Christ.
Which is the best- DaVinchi Code or Rozabal Line?? Well, undoubtedly, It has to be Sanghi's novel. Fusing the lives of so many characters, who have their own personal history, interrelating them and intertwining their lives- phew! A difficult task indeed. But Sanghi is able to pull it off. the result- an exceedingly exciting and equally thrilling and engaging read. Truly a PAGE-TURNER. Sanghi is successful in combining so many complicated storylines in a neat and macabre fashion. Yes, it is complicated sometimes. The reader may get confused in relating and remembering the countless stories that span over centuries and countries. But then you have the pleasure to read the best thriller. Sanghi has this beautiful habit of concluding his books with a pleasing philosophy- which goes on to prove the unity in the fundamentals of all religion. This philosophy removes the tension present in the story and acts as a sort of a midas touch to the book. VERDICT: Grab this book and read it. For once the world has to accept the fact that SANGHI HAS DEFEATED ALL THE WRITERS OF THE GENRE.
I was intrigued about the Indian style to Dan Brown writing and was sadly disappointed. I am afraid I found it a shoddy piece of writing. I had little to no interest in the remainder of the story and found myself skimming through aimlessly.
Having read krishna key, i had expected this book also to be good but this one turned tables on me. Although the writer's hardwork and inclination for mythology can be felt all along, inclusion of too many events and characters along with frequent switching between present and past makes us impatient. other books of author are worth reading. Disappointed.!!!
Read the book after Krishna Key .. found the book jumping form one narrative to the next too frequently . Flipkart packing and delivery .. amazing
I had read Chanakya's Chant and it was that book which lead me to this one. But then this was a complete let down. The author tried to make use of many concepts in the plot and did justice to none. There are so many loose threads and you are left with so many questions unanswered.
This is an interesting book full of insightful anecdotes. It is a very easy read. Ashwin is a master storyteller who can deliver insightful views with relevant analogies that will resonate with anybody.
This book was a perfect blend of amazing research and mediocre literal elements. There were several places where the story becomes more boring than Doordarshan serials. There is an untraceable chain of events that keep going on and on and you keep wondering whether you are in Japan or London or medieval Italy. Ashwin Sanghi has attempted to bring out a list of well researched facts about religious history and produced in the form of fiction so that people read. Story was a minor part. After you finish reading, you won't be able to spend two days praising the author - rather you will head over to wikipedia to see what actually happened in the past. There are several places which are filled of cliche phrases used by Indian English speakers - that suddenly bring you out of the book and make you put on a frowning face. However in everypage you'll learn a fact from history that will make you gasp in wonder. You will find lots of clichéd phrases commonly used in Indian English. There are no elements of surprise. Don't buy this book if you are regular reader who reads one book every week.
It was my impulsive purchase, as I was so impressed by my orevious read of " Chankya's Chant" and "The Krishna Key". The Plot is a massacre, haphazard and most of all boring.... Not expected from Aswin , any way the others books of him are must read.
Absolutely stunning, by the way author took the story. Good plot, good narration... As I mentioned in title, he is an Indian Dan Brown. With this book, world will know, how great our Indian people were once upon. If someone do research on religions, like me, please keep a copy of this book as your reference. Packing and delivering service of Flipkart is above our expectations. Hats of to Author and Flipkart Service.
The author has created a myth out of thin air. There are many discrepancies and distortions in the narration. Again the language is very ordinary without any literary attributes. I will not recommend this book to amyone.
I mean what was he trying to do, It was an "attyachhar". I am sure when the author himself would have read his work after completing it, he himself would have ended up scratching his head or worst fainted. And it was a real bad day for me when I saw people comparing his crap with great DAN BROWN and I enthuiastically purchased the book. May good god forgive all those. ;) ........ Every single page contains at least two new names with their biography and two new timelines and all of if weaved with some random story which you will never get to understand where to fit with respect to the main storyline; And this is because for more than half of the book you wont know what the main storyline is. I guess he was more obsessed with writing it rather than seeing to it that the reader connects to it. Still in the end I will say, you like his work or hate it; It's personal choice; but please dont compare his work (with no depth at all) with that of Dan Brown. He will jump off the cliff :P
As always...very good service by flipkart. Ashwin Sanghi have provided the reference for the facts that are stated in the book. have got me into reading those references to get more information.
it took me about 15 days to complete this book. The events were so varied and were described with such clarity, the linking with our history and the mysteries of the ancient texts were so vivid, one needs to ponder over every word. It seems possible that Jesus had spent his last days in India. The same theory has been extensively put forward by Dan Brown in his widely acclaimed and criticised book, ' da vinci code'. The eternal existence of the soul and the common origin of all religions is quite believable and acceptable. Kudos to Ashwin for presenting the complex nature of the soul in such a simple and systematic manner. One tends to get carried along because the entire book is based on the age old principal of ' as you sow, so you reap'.
the lost days of christ. Christ survived crucification and many myths all interwoven ambitiously. It is a good read if you can keep track of the skeletal story and look past the over feed of charecters and information
I purchased this book along with The Krishna Key... I had already read The Krishna Key... But somehow it fails to keep me engaged... The Krishna Key was another story...(Gripping) This book puts me to sleep... Maybe because somehow the logic that Jesus is but a Kashmiri Priest Issa is a bit boring... Tried very hard to link and add logic but this is an epic failure... Its over 3 months I purchased this book and i haven't even read it half... Clearly its very disappointing... Not worth my money... I have The Chanakya Chant pending to read... But after this i am not reading anything for a while... Need a break!
After reading 'Krishna Key', I decided to read this book hoping that it will be on similar lines. However I find this book quite confusing though thoroughly researched. The story keep jumping between past and present and between places accross world. Too many plots and characters makes it difficult to really relate the things and understand the plot. After reading first few chapter, I have put this book down.
The Rozabal Line, an Indian version of Da Vinci Code, starts very well, and binds the reader for the first couple of chapters. It then takes a very large number of incidents spread across space and time, and knits them into a good storyline to set up a climax that could do Ludlum or Dan Brown proud. The plot is intricate and unpredictable, though not entirely new. Dan Brown’s influence is evident, as is the author’s interest in world history. A recommended read for Indian readers who will perhaps relate more to it than to Da Vinci Code. There is more exposition than is usually tolerated by western readers. As an Indian reader, I found the treatment of karma and rebirth a little bizarre. Overall, one of the better popular fiction book coming out of India.
you can very well say that it's shit piece of work,pure copy of Dan Brown & very well predictible.I thought it must be good book ,but to utter dismay Ashwin Sanghi,cannot pace the story well,nor do he explain the characters well
About the book: The story line of the novel, I must say, is at par with Dan Brown novels. The start is really good and engrossing. However, once the historical evidences start coming into the picture the novel become too confusing to keep the track of events. This novel does not appear to be at par with the other two novels of the author. Flipkart Service: As experienced before, the service was outstanding. Received the book on next day itself. NB: The rating refers only to the novel and not the service
The book is good and well researched. Although, the story is not as big as it seems in the book, mostly the information are there, related with book and its theme. It is enjoyable for those who have not been in depth of history as there are many things to explore in a single book. If you know history and believe in controversial matters, or want an another food for your thought, you are most welcome to read. Personally, i liked the book just because it shared many things with us, not for the storyline.
Just finished the book bought from flipkart. In comparison to other two Ashwin Sanghi books- The Krishna key and Chanakya's chant its a disappointment. It only contains lots and lots of information without any gripping storyline. It seems to be more like a diary rather than a book. The author tried to copy the style of Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code but failed to instil the same amount of suspense and writing quality. Although its very much informative but overall its boring and too long.
The book is a unique piece of extensive research and the plot is very strong, but it could have been made simpler. At some places the book is very confusing, as there are too many characters involved. It's about whether Jesus lived in India, or not, and one can roam almost entire world in this book, but the actual meaning of 'Rozabal-Line' clarifies in the last few chapters. Nevertheless, a good read! :)
A good book with nice language and text but.... Felt like reading Dan brown books...the author should definitely have his own way of writing... I guess Tats Wat s missing in tis book... I hope the next book ll be okay upto my expectation...
The story line is good .Very interesting ,keeps you engrossed.He has done extensive research.Kudos to him for that.I was totally engrossed & did not want the book to finish.But the down side is that it jumps between people ,centuries & ideas a lot . Thus one tends to get confused.You are always trying to figure out & connect things.On the whole I think it is a good book.
'The Rozabal Line' may seem a little complex at first having too many characters and constantly switching between the past and the present.But that aside,the book is very interesting and has been extensively researched.It is thoroughly enjoyable and a really good read.
Ashwin Sanghi's Book Rozabal Line again reiterates the fact that He is one Indian writer who before writing the book does a through research on its subject...Ashwin has woven different Mythological stories with contemporary world very flawlessly. His research carries a authority of a Historian and his writing a mark of excellence. Very griping Story and very well presented.
The Rozabal Line follows too many threads in the story pulling in things & events from different timelines, present to before christ, and mixing-n-matching characters using the reincarnation tool. It is such a hotchpotch khichdi that it could give you indigestion.
I picked this book up having read Chanakya's Chant and being impressed by the author. This book was promised to be another mythological - modern time amalgamation thriller. However, this one turned out to be a let down. The suspense, the pace and the storyline were of a much lower quality than Mr. Sanghi's other book. Give this a miss and read Chanakya's Chant again!
Highly researched book. Author is boldly presenting many hidden things for the public. In fact I was doing research in few things he has already dealt with. Many secret documents, facts and belief are unearthed though in a fiction book. Presentation is in a moviescript style similar to Da Vinci Code. Hope one day this will become a movie. This book should get more visibility.
Just finished reading "India's best selling theological thriller". If there is something called induced dyslexic shock, I am undergoing that, for the story has jumped around so many times and taken so many incredulous turns that my thinking process is a mess. How a book that has so many repetitions, borrowed so many ideas from other works that it looks like a collage, and squeezed too many ideas to lack any depth can win critical acclaim in media and be a best seller, is a mystery someone can write a best seller about. This clearly proves that, the media can be unreliable as objective reviewer and is more of a subjective and powerful marketer. I am very happy that its a best seller in only in our country and everywhere else it will remain an unknown self published junk. I am taking a rest before I read Sanghi's other "best sellers"
Book was good, on the plot and on the story, they way he has tried to move the story, everything was good, except the way he has actually moved it through his writting... it was a good read alltoghether
First kudos to the author for his extensive research. I felt there was too much information about the background that made me difficult to stick to the plot and being engrossed. Its not that enjoying unlike his other works namely The chankya chant and The krishna key. But still its worth giving a try.
Initially when I ordered the book I thought it would be a good timepass reading which I can do before going to bed. However as I started reading it was engrossing enough to keep me awake. A nice plot intriguingly weaved across timelines and across philosophies. One needs a very open mind and neutral thinking throughout the book to actually come grasp the noble motive of the story flow. However at many times I felt the book got a little complex to recollect the story link. Too many facts, dates, locations and charachters were introduced and removed from the book in just a couple of chapters. Though in the end it all makes sense but one may need patience to actually continue reading throught those chapters. Overall a good read
Certainly best book by Ashwani Sanghi ......5 stars for writing style and 3 stars for story .....There are some loopholes in the story ...but the book is a total paisa vasool and foot grabbing...it just catch u in the twirls of the story
Too much information with too little story. Unlikely assumptions like strong secret societies come to an end because a few people die.. Looks like author wants to demonstrate his knowledge rather than his storytelling skills. Though I liked his other works, this novel was not up to my expectation and was bored to death. Hope information overdose will be reduced in his next works..
Awesome book. Helps you look at historical details beyond the known and taught facts. Gives you an alternate perspective on things. Have read all the 3 books of ashwin sanghi, Krishna key, chanakya chants and now this. Amazing detailing and fact churns.
The author's extensive research and efforts are to be appreciated. The plot is too good but the narration is confusing. There are a lot of characters and places which intrigues the reader a lot, especially in the first half. The story spans over continents and centuries which makes it difficult to recollect when one moves to subsequent chapters. The connection with the title itself was missing till u reach the last chapters. Till then the book is more about whether Jesus lived in India or not. The revelation of the Rozabal Line is not up to the mark. The novel is gripping in the mid chapters but is more of imagination rather than facts by the end. Trying to include more facts (fiction?)than required does make the reading cumbersome. However, the references included in the appendix section are noteworthy as it helps the interested reader to probe further. The story has been woven very intricate. Overall, the book is good and worth a read for sure for fiction lovers. The quality of the book cover is very bad. The paint actually sticks to your fingers. By the time you finish reading the book, “The Rozabal Line” is completely gone ! Flipkart for sure provides a great service. Great packing and timely delivery !!!
A good attempt at theological fiction by an Indian. Mr. Sanghi has to be congratulated for his effort. There are many things that make this book some what disappointing ... firstly, the author tries hard to create a fast paced thriller plot without thinking much about the average reader out there ... some of us cant follow 13 parallel story lines at once ! the names of fictional secret organizations are hardly impressive and look made-up ... the author imitates many aspects of Dan Brown's way of writing ... including anagrams, parallel story lines etc but fails to do a convincing job.. the effort is there but the quality is lacking ... the story is there but the philosophy is lacking ... the pace is there but a thrilling end is lacking .... this book is a huge disappointment ... Flipkart is great as usual ... timely delivery and good packaging ... keep up the good work guys.
THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ARE TOO TWISTED. HISTORICAL FACTS RECORDED AND INDEXED BUT STILL MAKES NO SENSE. EVEN IF WE AGREE TO THE PREMISE THAT JESUS WAS INSPIRED BY BUDDHA, THE REST OF THE STORY MAKES NO SENSE. AND BLAMING THE ILLUMINATI, CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND ISLAMIC TERRORISTS IS JUST ABSURD. EITHER TREAT THE BOOK AS A PURELY FICTIONAL THRILLER OR A BASELESS THEOLOGICAL THRILLER. BUT DONT GIVER REFERENCES FOR FACT AND SAY THE REST IS FICTION!
I had the oppurtunity to read " Chanakya's Chant" and "The Krishna Key" from the same author and was extremely impressed by his writing and recommended these books to many of my friends and relatives. Thereafter I read "Rozabal line" but was totally disappointed. A real waste of time.
the book is well researched time to time backed with references. fiction is correlated to reality in a very fine manner. mr.sanghi's novels are a blend of global notes merging to form a tune but I still liked his chanakya's chant also Krishna key much better.
The Rozabal Line is Ashwin Sanhi`s take on an age old contraversy that defies time and spreads across the whole world. While the concept is intriguing (Has to be, its a conspiracy theory isn`t it), credit must go to the author for weaving inextricably a story around which the protagonists feature as a race against time. The book is a definite page turner, but personally I feel it hasn`t reached the potential it could have. Somewhere there is a feeling that so much more could have been achieved but it still falls short.
My reactions are mixed. While Ashwin has done a terrific job on researching history (and documenting them in the glossary), the book lacks that "Wow factor". It waves across places across the globe and over centuries and millenia effortlessly. Unfortunately, he has tried to dump all the information somehow in this novel. It makes the novel complicated. I loved Chanakya's Chant being better to be able to relate to it. Nevertheless new age Indian Authors are really churning out some good reading...
an amazing book by Ashwin Sanghi..well researched.. can be compared to dan brown... packed with great facts and wonderful storyline.can be a little confusing at times. the best part is the refrences given at the end. a great book for someone who is interested in history.
One of the best thing about this book is the appendix Section where the sources have been quoted and provides a scope to the reader for further reading.The book has been extensively researched and the the stories are really amusing. The story keeps oscillating between the present day fiction plot and the historical anecdotes providing a smooth and interesting flow to this novel. The theory of Brian Weiss has been used really well and and the plot has been knitted really intricately. However I felt there was an information overload and too many characters leading to confusion. Still I would recommend this to anyone who takes interest in history/mythology. Wonderful Thriller
This is the world's shittiest book ever ever written in the history of literature. Just puking a research onto paper without proper plot doesn't claim to be a novel. This book is an insult to word 'Novel'. Hundreds of characters, thousands of places. Nothing described properly. This is just a collection of jotted down notes of the author, when he read wikipedia in his free time. Its Funny to see people comparing the author to The Great Dan Brown. Its just an insult to The Da vinci code as well as Dan brown.
This is mind boggling read. I recommend this for all the political and religious lovers. This book has it all to keep you excited and intrigued till the last page. I purchased the book during September 2012 and it kept me in good attention and brilliant excitement for a good 2 days. Really gets one thinking about a lot of things about religion and politics. A lot of it stands true out of the books and in to our little worlds and our beliefs. I definitely think this book is one for the old age library for a read before I die.
The Rozabal line is a very very interesting read about the origins of Jesus Christ, theories about his childhood years spent in India, his philosophy & teachings inspired by & derived from Buddhist, Hindu teachings,whether he survived crucifixion; his afterlife in India, marriage to Marry Magdalene, his surviving bloodline etc. This is the first ever genuine attempt by an Indian author to delve into history, back his hypothesis by logical references & findings, and twist an interesting global conspiracy to make it a tasty brew,a readers delight!! Though the plot loosens up & becomes dull at some places but for a debut-ant its more than a commendable effort & its a must read for all conspiracy buffs & history lovers alike!!...Indeed Mr Dan Brown has met with a learned Indian challenger...well done Mr Ashwin Sanghi!! :)
The Rozabal Line is Ashwin Singhi’s first novel, which he published under a pseudonym (Shawn Haigins) with Lulu Press, a self publishing firm. It was later published by Westland. The Rozabal Line, an Indian version of Da Vinci Code, starts very well, and binds the reader for the first couple of chapters. It then takes a very large number of incidents spread across space and time, and knits them into a good storyline to set up a climax that could do Ludlum or Dan Brown proud. The plot is intricate and unpredictable, though not entirely new. Dan Brown’s influence is evident, as is the author’s interest in world history. The plot is good and expansive, the characters are good and so is the setting. It is only the writing style that detracts from an otherwise excellent novel. The entire book is a series of extra-short scenes and snippets, some that are only a short paragraph. The constant flitting from place to place and across time makes reading tiresome and the flow jerky after a few chapters. The author’s penchant for darting all over the place is also evident in his second novel, Chanakya’s Chant, but to a lesser degree. Despite the annoying style, I liked The Rozabal Line more than Chanakya’s Chant. The incidents in this book are more credible that in Chanakya’s Chant. I was pleased to find it available as an eBook on Amazon for Rs 58, when the physical book was priced at Rs 176 in Flipkart. I grabbed it. A recommended read, particularly for Indian readers who will perhaps relate more to it than to Da Vinci Code. There is more exposition than is usually tolerated by western readers. As an Indian reader, I found the treatment of karma and rebirth a little bizarre. Overall, one of the better popular fiction book coming out of India. Overall Rating: 3.5 / 5 Sub-ratings: Setting (4); Story (4); Characters (4); Writing (2)
It was truly an enthralling experience to read the rozabal line.ashwin sanghi has truly created a work which goes much beyond the mere concept of fiction or thriller. the way various historical facts have been brought up and weaved together with such fineness that it seems that all the historical events which took place in the past had a connection with each other. It literally makes a reader to wonder at every page the moment one incident starts showing its connection with the other. The hard work which the author has put in to bring up this book is highly appreciable. A thriller which begins as a story about the credibility of Jesus Christ’s existence goes on with the conflict between two major world religions. In between shows how various organizations use religion for their motives. Ultimately ends praising the divine feminine power. A perfect blend of history, religion and fiction leading one to the world of conspiracy. A thoroughly researched book which brings us the complexities of the religion. It’s absolutely fantastic. Kept me spellbound till the end.really a thought provoking book. A must read.
the first thing that comes to my mind after reading this book is...OMG so much research he has put in writing this book. but that is the root cause of all the confusion for me. too many characters, too much of back and forth in time, too much of religious details discussed in this book confuses the reader and i am sorry to say that The Rozabal Line loses the line. he bombards the reader with so many facts that an average reader suffers from 'information overload' i bought this book after reading Chanakya' chant and like a normal reader i am bound to compare the two. i expected this book to be as good as chanakya' chant but i was disappointed. i have high hopes from ashwin's next book and have already pre ordered it. hope he doesnt disappoint this time.
I had already gone through with the research of Holger Kersten and others and hence, the basic :theory" was already quite clear to me. However, I must say that this book is also a good read and is flooded with details and references of the same. Fascinating, but sometimes - do much of details, are hard to digest! Anyways, the plot is cool and the writing style is at per with Dan Brown.... This is a however a good read, nevertheless :)
An extremely sad read when you compare it to the Chanakyas Chants' fast pace, tight storyline. This book, gets lost in trying to tie all those loose ends. Too many characters, and too much confusion for me, personally. The ending is more disappointing than one would expect it to be once one is reading the book. Poor plot, poor book. Somehow after reading you can't wonder but how the book would have been, had some other author with a brilliant editor could have worked on this research. If you are thinking of buying this, after you have read through the Chanakya's Chant, HOLD ON. Strictly recommended that you buy some other fiction title, but this.
I think enough has been said about this book which is an undisputed best seller... all I can add is that its a good piece of research, imagination and creativity... such a cool thriller.. it has been compared to Dan Brown's Da Vince code and i must say people might not know about rozabal as much as they would about vinci code.. but this book for all its comparisons.. truly doesn't let you down... its well researched and intelligently written that only leaves you with a lot of thoughts and desire to search so much more...
Chanakyas chant was such a great read that I almost impulsively bough The rozabal line. It was a big mistake. Although the author has done very good research and the connections and conclusions drawn are akin to Dan Brown, he fails miserably to keep me interested. There is an overload of data with very little actual story. In the end, I was just trying to get it over with. It became like a history textbook that was edited to look like a story. My honest opinion is not to purchase the book.
The first half seemed confusing with too many paralel stories and back and forth narrative style.for ..too many years and you will not understand if you have not read Da vinci....However, the book gets a grip as you go forth only to pull it down in the end with more confusing twists and turns..till you get to the end with a climax like ..a la bollywood style....read it if you dont have anything else to do....
some one as to have guts to put those words in a book...and he did that with style and eloquence ,.. a bit complex to digest the facts... but interestingly i ended up thinking and working my mind why can't it be true ? ... the author still known to many because of his second novel( chanakya's chant).. but this one is comparatively taken a bigger horizon.. taking us nearly to 100+ geographic location.. with 350 + pages ... brilliant,unputdownable,new style and one of the best novel by an INDIAN.... waiting desperately for his third novel...( the Krishna key )
Right from the beginning, this book hooks the reader throughout. An Indian Dan Brown in the making.Interesting and adventurous, the story takes the readers on a roller coaster ride across the globe! Enjoyed every bit of it! Would definitely recommend it.
The book stirs interest in the beginning but fails to hold it till the end. Parts of the content stir up mind - but occasionally though. A good read if you are a "Novel-o-holic". But, if you are not that ardent a reader, it requires you to master both your memory & patience. Try it at your own interest.
da vinci code was a fiction. This is also a fiction but based on real facts. I mean you can't write the history as it is. You must make it interesting & Ashwin Sanghi aka Shawn Haigins did a brilliant job of Lying. As he himself said in an interview that IF YOU WANNA LIE, LIE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO TRUTH. brilliant brilliant book. Just buy it!!
If you are new to mythological thriller, then the 1st 100 bore you, then next 100 pages will make you glued to the novel and remaining pages you would like to complete as soon as possible. First of all, I completed reading this one couple of weeks ago, but still can't believe that its a fiction. Seems like an Encyclopedia on religions. Also, Ashwin is intelligent like Chanakya who knows how and when to use the words. Ashwin connected the links so efficiently that the reader will perceive himself what the author wants to convey. Also as the story gets further, you would automatically link different events and other short important verses. Containing events of through-out the globe, Ashwin tells us how the religions were formed. A must read for all. It might be difficult for you to grasp in the beginning, but after reading completely, you will know what the novel is all about.
Ashwin Sanghi has done it..!! An excellent buildup of a story from Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE... The plot takes you through many countries with great twists and turns at every page... One of the best books I've read in quite a while... Don't miss this adventure for the world!!
i've found many clues to my questions about religion through this book. +1 if you are a christian, you'll grow strong in Faith. Highly recommended for those who don't want to be a blind believer. Shawn Haigins is absolutely brilliant.
When I first read about this book and I was so excited to read the same and soon I ordered the book . The plot of the book is on the same sensitive and controversial issue of Jesus Christs Resurrection & Secrets of Catholics and Illuminati same that Dan Brown raised in his book 'Da Vinci Code' but this book interestingly discussed the visit of Jesus in India . The book is well researched, full of knowledge and author truly deserves accolades for this . At the very starting it seems to be a gripping tale but soon due to lots of information it further gives a feel of General Knowledge book rather than a fiction.The author went on discussing the events at unusual pace . In the same chapter he described events almost from all the centuries which is hard for a average reader to grasp and also to remember lot of information. This was a decent attempt and again truly laudable. There are certain things that to some extent covers the shortcoming and make it a good average book to read. The concept of linking Catholic & Illuminati activities to terrorist insurgencies was intelligent. Mixing of Hindu mythology makes it interesting and description is done with perfection and one will surely love that. The end is a panache as the author pointed out the importance of feminine power using the protagonist of the story in a subtle and conceptual way. If you are a book junkie then go for it.
I bought this book as I was impressed with Chanakya's Chant, the other book of Ashwin Sanghi. But to say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. Right after the first few pages, we can clearly see that the writer is quite amateurish. The story is a poorly cooked plot including every possible conspiracy theory on the internet. If you are new to reading books, then you might find the plot exciting, but anyone who has read some good books can not bear the writing style or the absolutely cliche'd twists throughout the book.
My mY! Great read guys ! A well researched book... Doesnt bore u ! I finished this in 4 days ... Level of literature is good.. Just check out the links at the end... U start wondering what if? it was true not fiction ! In the end, the story starts coming togethar and every line starts giving out shockers to u! MUST READ !
Thanks for flipkart.com for its service. fast, reliable, secure. The Book Is a Real Thriller With A Great Plot that emerges when combining Myths and a Purely Fictional Story Perfectly. Though it will look complex at begining, as the story proceeds every complexity dissolves. Must Read for Myth Lover and Fiction Lover.
I first read the second book of the writer ashwin sanghi the chanakya's chant which was a very nice book i expected a lot from this book but this book disappointed me.The book reminded me "Angels And Demons" & "DA-Vinci-Code" written by Dan Brown.Though there are many cons the author added the concepts if the indian mythology and also he show cased the related the similarities between all kinds of the languages.
So much has already been said about the book in the other reviews so I will keep this brief. I picked this up because of two reasons - 1. Loved Chanakya's Chant, so wanted to read Sanghi's other work. 2. It talked about religions and its myths. I like the genre. An excellent book with lots of interesting facts to digest. Things I DID NOT like: 1. The link between the several parallel stories gets confusing specially with tons of historical names to digest. 2. The ending was really DISAPPOINTING ! Hard to digest, kiddish and in-your-face stupid.
The book is certainly well researched and pregnant with possibilities, but the author takes you through the narrative at a breakneck speed, it's almost like watching agent Vinod. The plot jumps across timelines, geography and characters without dwelling on the details. The characters are not built properly and hence tend to remain vague. It became rather difficult to complete the book.while the plot is promising , it certainly required more fiancé to get it across to the reader.
Its a great thriller which keeps you hooked till the end.It takes time to get used to the writer's style of depicting the things been happening in the story but once you overcome it then it is really hard to get your eyes off it. Gets bit slow in the middle but the suspense maintained makes you think throughout what is going to happen. Facts & fiction have been well interwoven in the story. A must read : )
Finished it at last, it's a time pass book with quit a gripping tale. Some of the content are really interesting and somehow gives you a thought of having it true, but it's not. Writing is really-really impressive, just a hint of immaturity in past life experiences tracks. Well, what I really don't enjoy is ending, it's too much dramatic causing overreacting on same topic again and again without any need. Sometimes it's appear like show off of India or Hinduism, no offence. But after all it's fun to read this book, after all it's fiction. Have a Fun...
Well, it feels good to see that an Indian Author is coming up with a book which on the lines of authors like Dan Brown. The Plot related to Jesus, surely generates the hype, at least for the people of have like The Da Vinci Code. The Story covers almost every continent, century, religion and philosophy. And that is where things have gone out of control. In the end, the mere wrapping of the events and facts brings a conclusion of an essay but not of a novel. The Resources are very well researched and acknowledged by the author. Notes, Acknowledgements and Reference are very well given at the end of the novel, thereby reducing the chances of igniting any controversy. But hats off to Ashwin for this attempt and putting forward a view which is as interesting as any conspiracy theory.
I read this book after reading Chankya's Chant. I was very impressed with the previous book that i was expecting more from this one. This book came out to be a very bad attempt to match Dan Brown. I found the narration very bad with in one page narrator was going through three time periods and you tend to forget all those things while you read it. I would recommend one to read Dan Brown instead of this.
this book makes feel "Davinci code" and "Angels and Demons" look like a lullaby. From 5000BC to 2012AD, from Zoroastrain to christianity, islam, Hinduism, Budhism and Mayan calender author takes you on a nile biting journey. From the office of US president to vatican city, from jerusalem to kashmir, from israel to russia, hunt begins in the search of the blood line of Jesus. From illuminati to other anti-church organisations, from al-quaeda to ISI, and many other political transactions in the shadow of religions take place between islam and christianity. the most appealing part is the references provided, which is adding controversial facts to fiction. this makes the story more gripping.
Ashwin Sanghi tries to create a fast paced story which flashes from the early ages to the modern day like a Dan Brown Novel. He does capture the audiences attention for a large part of time but where this novel lacks is the depth of research when compared to its contempraries like Angels and Demons,Da Vinci code etc. Still a commendable piece of work by a Indian author who tries at a genre of religious thrillers which have become the latest biggest thing in Indian fiction!
The novel starts on a promising note, but in the end the flippant, in fact juvenile use of wordplay and acronyms, the proliferation of just too many plot lines, waters down the book to a very mediocre piece of work. This is really sad considering the amount of research which the author seems to have done. A real waste of what could have been accomplished with the underlying premise.
A good read. In the line of Da vinci code and Angels & demons. Though, I know the story is truly fictional, I felt like believing the whole plot. Really enjoyable to Indians, and those who know Hinduism and India.
Bought this after reading "Chanakya's Chant"..so my expectations were high..it lived up to the expectations..but in parts.. I think the plot was great with several good twists n turns..it maintains good pace at the beginning wanting you read on continuously... but somehow loses its fizzle when it goes into too much detail..especially towards the end..it could definitely have been much better.. All in all a good read which could do with a better end..
lots of research and painstaking linking whichsometimes tends to get overdone. but a great read especially if someone has a passion for some history and some mystery. I was intrigued by the build up and nice to see a Cathedral boy taking such deep interest in matters spiritual and temporal
Not much on my expectation, i like the chanakya chant more then this one by the same author. Anyway its my opinion you may have your own. I also rated the book as a feel it is. Very interesting begining, but in last seems like writer just want to wrap up all the things in very sudden.
this is the 1st book i bought from flipkart.It seems that author is just trying to be Indian Dan Brown but failed poorly. If you have already read Da Vinci code or The lost symbol you will find it boring from the very first page.
The book was definitely a delight for fans of this genre. The storyline spanned generations and across continents. The intelligence of connecting the dots between Jesus and the other religions with a heady mix of a parallel fiction track is superb!
I found the book quite interesting and entertaining...yet at parts the book seemed a bit boring and too complicated for predictable portions. quite a lot awesome in phases though. Overall quite a recommendable book and specially Mr. Sanghi has come out with another magnificent novel in Chanakya's chant which is truly lovable
In The Rozabal Line, a thriller swirling between continents and centuries, Ashwin Sanghi traces a pattern that curls backward to the violent birth of religion itself. The first work of author before his book chanakya chant and while you start reading this book you never found any thing that its a first book of this author every thing pen down with detail and after a very keen observation and research. Thought the book is fiction but it will produce a thrill and swirls of question in one`s mind that if he is capable then its a book that make you sit till end .... Ultimate book i brought it after reading chanakya chant and it gives same trill and enjoyment of reading .... great writer ,really looking some more titles from him soon this year.
Its the first time that I've read a Ashwin Sanghi Book, compared to Dan Brown's Series ....book was a perfect thriller from an Indian where author has gone in depth to mix historical findings with fiction. Over time various authors brought out books on Jesus and his History specially with India...the book continues in the same lineage woven around few characters who refreshes our memory on the historical findings to create a captivating thriller. Should read Jesus in India, Da Vinci Code to have a background on what the story is made around. A read for people who are open minded and pass it off as a fiction and has interest in thriller series. I've already ordered for Ashwin's: Chanakya's Chant with much expectation
The way the facts and History has been mingled with fiction and presented in the book is just mind blowing. I am simply amazed with information I have received from this novel , thats its kind of hard to absorb in me . But I am actually very Happy that we have a great writer like Mr Ashwin Sanghi , who have the calibre ,matched with his unmatched research combined with his Intelligence to deliver such an interesting read ! Thank you Mr Ashwin.
It’s a muuuussssstttt read. A good read for people who liked Dan Brown. The writer has got all the elements needed for a near perfect story. A good research done by him. I recommend it to all those people who are interested historical stories and have an open mind to understand the logic of some events.
I have already read it 90% and i didnt feel the book is as good as other review tells. The story moves between different places and different time lines but it moves so fast that u will loose the interest. But, the information writer has collected to write the book is amazing. Have to give respect for that !
A boring book... The reviews were...wow, so amazing. People were comparing this book with [book:The Da Vinci Code|968] and the author with [author:Dan Brown|630]. I was so tempted to read it. All the book contained is a collection of myths of different religion which points out that jesus was not killed in the cruxifixion, but lived lived and died in India and supported Sacred Feminine with some more myths. The book was so confusing. All the myths were connected using a fictious story, who confused me even more. The book would have been good, if it had only the last 25 pages. The last 25 pages of story is what was clear to me, the rest was a pure mess. It might be used a myth-reference-guide, if didnt have that fictious story through out...
If conspiracy is what you like, read Dan Brown. He is not a good author, to say the least, but he atleast manages to keep the reader hooked. This book is just a consortium of those "hooks". The reader is interested, for a point, and then he is thrown into a different scenario altogether. When he starts to make head or tail of things, ohh wait, there is another "hook" waiting, which has nothing to do with whatever sense the book was making till the point. There is no character development and no plot development. It is just a mess.
Another Davinci code like mispropaganda that neither respects the Holy Lord nor the genius minds of the era. TOTALLY NON FACTUAL LIKE DAVINCI CODE, DEFAMES INTELLECTUTALS LIKE DAVINCI ( REMEMBER NEWTON DRAGGED INTO SOME MORON CLUB DOING ORGIES) AND BASED FULLY ON NON-AUTHORITATIVE INFORMATION AND WEBSITES OF SPURIOUS CREDITIBILITY. WHY BOOKS QUESTIONING JESUS CHRIST STATURE IS NOT GOOD? THE MAIN CORE OF CHRIST's TEACHING IS TO SERVE HUMANITY. Millions of missionaries sacrifice their happiness and serve on the core belief that christ loves and accepts people who serve others. What have we sacrificed in our life that we think we have the right to question JESUS CHRIST OR HIS MISSIONARIES? One nut case of a long vanished century wrote that the Lord kissed mary magdalene. why should the questioning be turned to the HOLY JESUS? Why not question the spurious nut case that wrote such lines against the Lord? I am neither a christian going to church nor i ever plan to visit a church. But i know in my heart i cant sacrifice a pizza leave alone an entire life of happiness to live a frugal and fully non selfcentred life of a christian missionary. There are millions of these christian missionaries and they serve in the remote corners of the world changing life positively by sacrifing themselves to be the only hope for nonprivileged people without means for education or medicine or family or food. If consistent desecration of Jesus Christ is done like this, what will happen to the funds that flow into Christian missions which serve humanity by their free hospitals, free institutions and free orphanages? The need of the hour is to mature and understand what it is we are destroying. Do we want to destroy a religion which spends most of its income in building free educational institutions & free hospitals & free orphanages? RECOMMEND HIS OTHER BOOK "CHANAKYA CHANTS" which is a thrilling and a much better work. This one is for Davinci Code fans only.
Too many subjects zipped into 300 something page book. It should have dealt only with the theme of Christ living in India after crucification.Instead it has jumbled with reincarnation theory, trinity in hinduism, murder, islamic militant groups, Illuminati and masonic theories. The last quarter of the book is totally confusing . Not worth second read.
Have to say there is a huge amount of information in this book and some of it quite interesting and forces you to think but the way it has been written is disappointing, the story jumps around a lot from different timelines and location, i expected this to be just in the beginning of the novel but it continued throughout the entire book which made it quite confusing.. the story handling was not smooth .. .. it could have been handled in better way... this book is ok for the readers who are fresh and have not read many books or novels, but for those who are accustomed to the style and solid plot elements of Dan Brown, Seldon, Or even Rowling this is a huge letdown, it failed to hold my attention for long, I was disappointed after reading the first 10 pages . its like a huge vat of 'Khichidi', there are all types different conspiracy theories (illuminati, opus dei, marriage and children of Jesus, past lives, reincarnation, doomsday prophecies) theres even a sexy assassin (why do the assassins always have to be sexy and beautiful? so typical), the author took all these and patched together a story, the characters are too stereotypical, cardboard personalities, with no characterizations, we cannot connect with any of them, they have no depth ... i have seen many praises written for this book but frankly i am surprised that the leading dailies have given it such good remarks ..what were they thinking? did they write those because it is written by an Indian writer? ... .. this book cannot in any way be compared to Da Vinci code ... it tries its best but falls way short.. in the end it is just a poorly written book which has done well because the majority of the people are unaware of the works from which it draws 'inspiration' If you like the topic of Jesus in India then I would recommend 'Jesus lived in India' By Holger Kirsten or 'Jesus in Kashmir, The Lost Tomb' by Suzanne Olsson instead, they are better way to spend your money and 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' which is about Jesus' supposed life after crucifixtion
superb...very knowlegeful...superb conclusion...want a sequel for this one
This book is complete and utter crap. I think first of all the people who even mention it on the same page as the DaVinci Code should check if they have any brains left in their heads. I bought this book because the authors other book Chanakyas Chant was a decent read. This is utter chaos. The story and the premise is ludicrous. The movement from one time to another worked in CC cause the move was between two time zones... Ashwin Sanghi cant handle it in this book but above all the multiple life things in this book is completely laughable... please dont waste your money on it.
i do not lament a loss of 135 bucks and as i was travelling, did not put it down which i would have done otherwise. the story about jesus et al is intriguing but the author has created a goulash with US President, CIA Director all jumping in the plot. that levitates the story and makes it look like one of those frivolous detective pocket books. there is historical knowledge imparted, but hardly worth retaining. you wont believe that pages of extraneous stories have deliberately been created so that the author could satisfy his whim of 'the law of karma'. again don't go by me, spend 135 and since it is not 531, you would not regret it either.
It's a book with a plot that can be covered in about 5 pages to which the author has added 250 pages of pure unrelated rubbish mostly picked up from the internet and wikipedia. Add to this gramatical and spelling mistakes and this is easily an avoidable book. This is one of those books I would't read even if I was paid to read it. I am truly baffled by all the praises being heaped on the book and its author something stinks!!
Occasionally one picks up a book judging it by its cover and the summary only to find the book incredibly boring and perhaps one of the worst you’ve ever read. The Rozabal Line by Ashwin Sanghi is one such book. Even attempting to read half of it is absolute torture. It is the first of two books written by Ashwin Sanghi, a businessman who claims to be “working towards a PhD in creative writing” if so, he clearly has much to learn. What he seems to be good at however, is sleek unethical marketing. Ashwin Sanghi has picked up loads of widely spread out random information available on the internet and has attempted to weave a connective thread through it and create a story. In all cases the connective thread of logic is so thin, only a raving lunatic would see it. If I could, I’d have loved to have my money refunded.
excellent plot building and informative novel. desparately waiting for chanakya's chant
This book for many reasons can compete with the Dan Brown novels. Jesus Christ coming to India is a topic which is much discussed and will continue to be for decades to come. The book is not a peremptory "fullstop" on the discussions but it does a lot to put India in a premier position in history. For, we the common people, still do not know what documents lie hidden within the Vatican Library. but Ashwin Sanghi does a wonderful job in tracing Jesus's footsteps to India. The history is well-researched and there are citations for the arguments that the reader might find debatable. In this context I might also add that the people reading this book should also watch the documentary "The Lost tribes of Israel" by Simcha Jacobovici. The book is a wonderful read, hardly ever drags and sustains the thrill till the end. The descriptions are vivid and hardly seems a debut novel. Another thing that the book does is to preempt the prestige and historical position for India, and that too within a Christian framework. To take the Christian religion and say that India was the root of it all is a brave statement. The author does it with Panache. The "past-life recollections" of the characters might seem a little exaggerated, though. But moreover the book scores high on a "thriller meter".
This was a badly written book in the Jesus Conspiracy genre. Much of the book is just excerpts put together from various conspiracy theories and too much jumping from one scene to another with no real thread stitching it all together. Some of it was far-fetched, and it would have made a decent story if only the author had taken time to knit it all together. In the end, it reads like a made remake of the Da Vinci Code.
The Rosable myth was created by Gulam Ahmad Qadiani to justify his claim that he is a reborn Christ. If at all Christ died here in Kashmir that was 2000 years before. There is no historical record regarding this. How come that a grve in Kashmir suddenly get identified with the Christ. The grave in Rosabal is certainly not in Muslim fashion.It is said to be grave of some Yuse Asif as per the local tradition. But is that the evidence of Jesus having been buried here. In fact,Mirza had absolutely no idea of the grave,till one Molvi Abdullah with whom he was staying during his sojourn in Kashmirtold him about the tradition. It was a wonderful opportunity for him to build upon this myth to claim his Christhood. The Mirza after declaring himself as Mahdi was in a tight spot.Mahdi had to be followed by Christ as per Islamic traditions. They have to be contemporaries. Later Molvi Abdullah exposed him in a pamphlet titled " A Leaping Fire in Khanyar" Khanyar is the place where the tomb is located.
i have not yet read the book.but its topic and reviews have developed a desire in me to read it. i was fedup of the books like davinci code by western novelists, who completely ignore hinduism, while talking ,(correcting)writing about global religions. in most of their novels they just talk about christianity, some times islam and also buddhism etc and always ignore hinduism, knowing the fact that gautam buddh was also a hindu and hinduism is the oldest religion in the whole world. so it a very great effort, i must say ,by the author to write something like this which tells its readers about hinduism, and at least it gets attention through the novel.hats off to the author,to introduce hinduism as a global aspect and tell its importance through book.its a kind of respecting it. i am gonna read this.
I enjoyed reading every page of this superbly written factual fiction in one sitting...a very original idea to peep into the history of world religions to gain a meaningful perspective of their basic fabric...Ashwin Sanghi has indeed emerged as the King of Historical Fiction...
This was one of the best books that I've read in a long long time. Even though the author claims that it is a work of fiction, there is so much material that he has packed into this 373 page paperback. For all practical purposes, Sanghi, convinces you that Jesus did indeed survive the crucifixion, that he traveled to India and that he is quite possibly the man who lies buried at the tomb in Rozabal (Srinagar). His style of writing is unique, interspersing history and fiction in short snippets along with scientific evidence to lend credibility to some of the fascinating claims. I plan to read The Rozabal Line once again because I was unable to absorb everything that this book had to offer. For someone interested in revisionist mythology, this is the book.
The Rozabal Line is a deliciously mischievous piece of work that throws facts at the reader (while making these facts sound like fiction) and builds a wonderfully intricate fictional plot (while making the fiction sound like credible theory). It builds slowly but the rewards and payoffs in the final third of the book are immense. I had the opportunity to hear Ashwin Sanghi talk about the subject matter of his novel at Landmark Chennai and I found some of the riddles posed by him to be truly fascinating. Having bought the book the very same day, I was happy to find that there were even more interesting (though debatable) morsels to be found inside The Rozabal Line -- Magdalene and Maghada, the trinity of the father-son-holy-ghost vis-a-vis the Hindu trinity of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva, the linkages between Abraham and Brahma, the forty days of Jesus in the desert vs. the forty days of meditating in the jungle by Buddha, the baptism by John the Baptist vis-a-vis the Kumbh Mela! I love this sort of stuff and The Rozabal Line is perfect for a theological-conspiracy fan like me.
One of the most terrible books I've read in the recent past. Having read a lot of books about Jesus and various theories about who he really is, I didnt find anything new in this book. Plus, the author's language skills aren't too good. Da Vinci Code is anyday better. I'd even suggest Michael Baigent's 'Jesus Papers' over this book! I'd not recommend this book!
The novel is too ambitious in its sweep. It seeks to bring the whole of human history, all of men’s religions and gods, civilisations and endeavours under one umbrella in just 357 pages. It fails to convince us in the process. The connections become too tenuous to convince. For example, Mary Magdalene becomes Mary of Magadha, yes, the same Magadha of Emperor Ashoka! Later the same Mary becomes three-in-one: goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswati and Kali! The notorious Muslim terrorist Ghalib becomes the latest incarnation of Jesus. The Judaic Star of David metamorphoses into the Hindu Swastika... Much of the plot is carried forward through spiritualist sessions of regression or progression: that is, going back into previous births or moving forward into possible futures using a medium. I think, for a vast majority of ordinary readers, this technique too will be unconvincing. I can, however, agree with the moral that Sanghi wants to convey: “There is something good to be found in all faiths.... The problem has never been belief but the deliberate misinterpretation and misuse of it” [p. 357] For the complete review log on to: www.matheikal.sulekha.com
Sam Bourne's "The Last Testament" earned the author the title of "The biggest Challenger to Dan Brown's Crown". Well ... Ashwin Sanghi might as easily lay claim to the same title! Instead of the fast paced action and startling revelations that one finds in the Da Vinci Code or The Last Testament (which, frankly, tended to be a bit too movie-like in places), the Rozabal Line relies on a constant flow of adrenalin - a feeling which, one can only guess, is probably similar to what is experienced by archaeologists who unearth secrets that re-write history! Reading this book has been one large "Oh My God" experience! One can only wonder at the immense research done by the author and the million dollar idea that ties all of the pieces together! This is as much a historical treatise as it is a work of fiction. Please Mr. Sanghi ... we crave for more!!
The Rozabal Line by newbie Ashwin Sanghi is what could be called intelligent fiction. The book should be read not because of great literary flourishes but because of the incredible manner in which various nuggets of history and theology have been stitched together to create a story of epic proportions. In recent years there has been considerable speculation that Jesus may indeed have spent his "missing years" (the unaccounted years between the ages of 12 and 30) in India. What Ashwin Sanghi does is to take this single nugget and tie it into several other little factoids. For example, the fact that one of the lost tribes of Israel may have settled in Kashmir; the fact that St. Thomas remained one of the closest friends of Jesus and settled down in India; the fact that the wise men searching for Jesus were very similar to Buddhist monks searching for the reincarnation of a Dalai Lama; the fact that Mary Magadalene may have had connections with Maghada, the ancient empire of Ashoka. All of the above factual narrative follows in parallel to a fictional track. The premise here is that if Jesus did indeed settle down in India post-crucifixion then it could be possible that his future generations could be Kashmiri Islamists. That hypothesis is explored further through a group of terrorists whose final fates closely resemble those of Jesus and his 12 apostles. For many, The Rozabal Line, will seem a trifle complicated. So, if you happen to be a Da Vinci Code fan, this may not necessarily be the book for you. But if you liked The Rule of Four by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason, a much more scholarly piece of fiction, the you would love Rozabal.
