This is an excellent book. It unfolds the worst secrets of Church. The writing style is awesome. Even after being an English author almost no slang or bad words are used. A must buy for all book lovers
A jaw-dropping experience, stupefied throughout the book... unfortunate to miss this stunning piece of writing
The best book i have ever read!! Very knowledgeable and interesting at the same time!!! As Good as a Harry Potter novel!
this is a must read book .. I culdnt stop myself to leave it in between .. My first thriller novel ! And i had a great experience with it ............ And i love flipkart ! ................................................................................................
Nail biting excitement, gripping, excellent plot bordering along reality which is a welcome departure when compared to imaginary world type stories. Robert Langdon...how could you not love that man. Churchy affairs have always been messy. This story exploits that part of our lives well which we choose to ignore. A happy 10 on a scale of 5 !! Must read.
Many people might think that they maynot be able to read the book hearing that is it has 550 pages. But it is truly worth the read! The book is awesome. I recommend this book to everyone who wishes to read crime thrillers. Grab a book quickly.
An amazing amazing book. I started reading it and just kept on reading it. It is damn good. I have also seen it's movie. Bot are very good. I have heard very good things about James Rollins books. It is said that they are equally good. It is vey interesting how the protagonist combines all the clues and comes up with a solutions . Never read a book like the da Vinci code. Definitely gonna read Dan Brown and will also read James Rolins. Highly recommeded to anyone who wants to read thriller.
Yes, It was clearly better than 'Deception point' by the same author. Got from flipkart at low price and delivery was as awesome as always. About book??? One does not simply read the review of the book of DAN BROWN. They all are amazing and The Da-Vinci Code is a masterpiece. I am amazed how creatively Dan Brown researches about topic he writes. Worth reading. Never felt bored. Amazing Ending. Beautiful cover. Buy it if you haven't read it yet. It will take place in your collection for sure. :)
this book is a THRILLER and adventure, it has a high IQ but that's what makes it interesting. contains things u would have never thought of , A MUST READ!! also read other dan brown books.. totally worth it
THE DA VINCI CODE BY DAN BROWN. THE MOST ENLIGHTENING AND AMAZING BIBLICAL THRILLER THAT I'VE READ. DAN BROWN'S WAY OF WRITING AND HOW THE STORY UNVEILS IS JUST AMAZING. THERE IS'T ONE DULL PAGE AND IS PACKED WITH THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED HISTORICAL LEGENDS AND FACTS. HIGHLY THRILLING AND YET CONTAINS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SET THE WHEELS OF YOUR BRAIN INTO MOTION. YOU CAN'T MISS THIS ONE!
the book is just awesome.......... must read this book and the best part is i got this book the next day when i ordered .... and at a very high discount... better than da vinci code movie.... while reading u can just picturise the scene in front of your eyes
I got it by recommendations from my friends and everyone who worshiped Dan Brown like a God! And yes, I wasn't disappointed by the book. It was one fabulous read, and the story, plot, characterization, was spectacular. The twists keep you on till the end, Robert Langdon and Sophie Nevue, both make a great combination. Teacher of iconography, and a cryptographer, decode the codes all along their journey to unsolve a murder mistery. It wasn't just a fiction story, but had a lot to learn too. Some things, I didn't know about the Christian-religion, some untold stories, like the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene, Knights of Templar, Secret Society, Cult Worship...in short, it's one of the best reads!
Though there are other books concerning religion, symbology, etc Dan Brown's masterpiece is unique; effortlessly blends fiction with symbology & real world history. It also introduces you to the world of cryptography - codes and puzzles! You need not have any knowledge of religion or history to dive into this one!! Whether you like fiction or thrillers, this book is a must read!
a must read book....... I havn't read anything before..... you won't be able to see DA VINCi in the same way the way you see him in earlier.... DON'T MISS IT.... OR ELSE... YOU ARE GONNA REGREAT FOR THIS
couldnt have got better........i feel this to be the best one from all the dan brown books.......ROBERT LANGDON what a creation mind blogging!!!!the whole story is based in Paris!!!!personally my favorite!!!i would say go for this book dont hesitate.. my guaranty wil turn out to be a blockbuster for u!
I read this book way back when it had released and this is one of those books which will send a shiver down the spine. Highly controversial and off course one of the best selling works of fiction of all time. This book brought Dan Brown overnight success and fame and later was made into a blockbuster movie. This book will make you question your religious beliefs so be ready for that. Read it. Enjoy it. Feel shocked. Must read book.
A heart racing thriller. The story has too many twists( it would be a sin to reveal the plot) and a complete page turner. Like all other Dan Brown's thrillers this one also mantains the concept of 'The culprit is withis us' and 'You can trust no one'. Its unputdownable. The author has skilfully established a link between symbols, history and modern crime. A heck of a good read..
A must read. One should read books of this sort often. Dan brown is simply amazing as far as the plot, the narration and the content goes. this book was released probably a decade ago. Still its one of the masterpieces. I would rate a 5 for Robert Langdon! :)
The book is so thrilling that ....some times u cant close the book even after 4-5 hours of reading..I bcom a great fan of Prof. Langdon.Dont miss this book.i prefer this book as one in best 50 books you should read before death..
This is the best book I have read in my life.. Truely amazing, the way it is narrated.. Hats off to the author for the splendid amount of backgroud study before starting to write off.. I couldnot stop myself from reading as the way the story takes us increases the urge to know what will happen next... Wonderful story line...
Absolutely brilliant.... Dan Brown is a perfectionist i would say.... The characters are created so well... So much attention is paid to each and every detail that a scene is created in front of your eyes... There is no loose end in the story.... Very delighted after reading such a freat book... Exceptional Stuff!!
one of my fav....a must for all the booklovers out there....because if u missed this one...then u r sure gonna regret it....didn't bought this from flipkart but highly recommend it as you would luv the service.....
Plot:A man in museum dies naked in Leonardo da vinci's Vitruvian Man's position.There is some message encrypted on his chest.Everything after this is related to the quest of finding Holy Grail.Will they be able to locate before its too late? Comment:A very good combination of detective,conspiracy theory and thriller plot. A good read.
its after such a long time next to sherlok holmes or agatha christie that got chance to read a novel like this.this has unmistakably evoked in me an intense passion for all sorts of thrillers.this novel is un-put-downable for its extreme suspense,thrill and humour.the line "...france-a country renowned for machisno womanizing and diminudive insecure leaders like nepolean and pepin the short could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than a thousand foot phallus" really put me into an incessant laughter.even now it has its effect on me.you all should get to this novel. thank you flipkart for your fast delivery.
DAN BROWN, once again proved that his books will be at the top most line. Coming to the book, The Da Vinci Code, is definitely a page turner.It provides anxiety among the readers.I got goosebumps sometimes while reading the book.Another aspect is the way the author used the terminology is at zenith. When the author describes the colossal structures of every monument, i felt like"imagining them in my brain". I strongly recommended this book for the people who are in search of thrillers along with some work to brain as well.
This novel is an extraordinary thriller! First 100 pages are a bit boring but then you'll just not be able to stop! I also watched the movie but it was a pathetic. This novel is really amazing. Again, good service by flipkart, got it within 2 days.
Have you seen any bad comments here ? So much for its acceptance. Indeed, you'd have this one in your collection. This is some narrative skill that'd make you stick to the book. Which means that you're not going to to put it down unless you finished reading. As they say "UNPUTDOWNABLE" ..!!
I loved reading this book...awesum work...with all its twists and turns..this book will keep you engaged till the climax. I dint buy this book from flipkart(i wish i had) but enjoyed it lavishly. Seriously i would recommend this book for one and all....it was a mesmerizing experience for me.... :)
I am amazed that how Dan Brown has brought this book to reality. Its literally the best book I have ever read. Seriously..your hairs will keep standing up on every ten pages. This book is revolutionary...A must have in your collection..
i am completely flabbergasted by dis novel...best thriller..must read for everyone...the style..the story..the suspense..u will not b able to leave the book once u start it...a very enthralling read..!! and again hats off to flip kart for their amazing service...i got d book d next day...!!
Could not find the option to give more than 5 stars, so 5 it is! This book is amazing in every aspect. The Holy Grail is sure to pick everyone's interest. Brown has blended every scene, every character with such lucidity that it is quite difficult to put the book down once you have started reading it. I must say to everyone who is confused about buying a suspense thriller, this is the best you'll find. Go for it. You won't regret it!!
davinci code is one of my favorite thriller. the reality based narration makes this book as a mind blowing thriller when i started reading i cant put it down every chapter is filled with page turning suspense..
This is my first book of dan brown. But i instantly loved it. This book undoubtley one of the best thrillers. The way he narrates the story in this novel keeps you on the edge of seat right through the end U will be a fan of dan brown for sure if u read this book
Dan Brown is an excellent writer. Every detail of monuments, brotherhoods and symbols mentioned in this book are real yet the story is a fiction. That's the beauty of this book. At the end you start questioning yourselves..."Did Jesus had a bloodline..Is it true?".
Brown has crossed all limits of thrilling entertainment and suspense in the book, with revelations so frightening that it won't let you believe your eyes on the written word. A must read for all the people regardless of age or background. The novel incorporates everything-a journey between two countries, tons of suspense at every step, startling twists and tuns, and an interwoven arena of time, mystery, space, history, crime, love, sacrifice, vengeance, and every other emotion one may think of. Excellent work. Captivates the reader right from its first word.
There may be lot of controversies going on around this book but this is one of the best fictional stories ever written. With a racy treasure hunt to find untold secrets that will put the beliefs of humans into question, you can also learn more about history. A must have for any fiction fan.
This book got many many rewards, and I no need to say more. This is the perfect book to start reading DB's writing if anyone haven't started yet. And, bought this book 3-4 months ago from the date of this review & service by flipkart is as awesome as always.
For many days I wanted to read this book and finally I bought it... In one word ... this book is awesome and the book is better than the movie. A very highly recommended book for thriller and conspiracy theory lovers.. And the FLIPKART experience...5 STAR as always..delivered in 2 days in which there was a Sunday.
This book was the best book i had ever gone across...I never had a like towards books until reading this.. Mind Blowing,This book made a interest towards puzzles, riddles, symbol and history.. Dan Brown really touch the cord with this one..A must have collection.... I already started collecting a lot books ..thanks to da vinci code...I really felt i had lost so many years without reading...
I had earlier borrowed this book from a friend and when i started reading, i could not leave it till i completed fully. An amazing thriller. So when my sister asked for a good thriller wit good amount of suspense, i could think of just one book The Da Vinci Code. I had it gift wrapped and sent it to her. She was surprised to get it and when she started, she too got hooked to his book. So if you are thinking of buying this book and have a love for suspense and thrill, do not think twice. Just click on buy.
This book is undoubtedly one of the best thrillers.....u can't even predict whats's going to happen next and the thrills and twists that happen in every page will glue you with this book .....my personal experience with this book has been amazing....in 4 days i have almost completed the book and i cant wait to read more!!! just don't think second time to buy this... If u r fan of thrillers u must buy this,if u r not a fan, after reading this i bet u will be!!!
This book indeed is the masterpiece by Dan Brown. From the beginning till end the delicacies and depth of descriptions of scenario, history spell will spell bound the reader. From me its a thumbs up with 5 stars.
This was one book that changed my attitude towards reading..........A must read , excellent book. You will not keep this book down unless you finish it. An exciting Thriller....with lots of twists and suspenses which will make you cling on it. you will have so many doubts and questions left after you fifnish the book too..
A fast, thrilling, and nail biting adventure of Harvard professor Robert Langdon who, with the help of Sophie Nevue, manages to solve the mystery of the Holy Grail, and thus of Mary Magdalene, who was believed to be the spouse of Jesus Christ. After an extraordinary adventure in 'Angels and Demons', Langdon makes a perfect comeback, and deciphers the actual truth about Da Vinci's works.
USUALLY I AM A SLOW READER, BUT IN THIS ONE I WAS TEMPTED TO READ ON AND ON AND ON, ITS SO FULL OF MYSTERY THAT PROMPTS ONE TO GO ON AND ON AND ON TILL YOU DECIPHER WHATS HAPPENING. A mix of thrill, knowledge, mystery and what not...
SUPERB BOOK I HAVE READ...I GOT TO KNOW MANY NEW THINGS...U WILL DEFINITIVELY LIKE DAVINCI EXPERTISE...THE STORY IS VERY MUCH GRIPPING.U WILL BE VERY MUCH IMPRESSED BY ALL THE REFERENCES GIVEN BY THE WRITER
The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a fast paced thriller where the main characters have to decipher clues in artwork, architecture and riddles to get to the bottom of a murder and save themselves. As a thriller, it is an O.K. pick, but not as good as Brown's Angels and Demons. The main characters discuss unsubstantiated religious ideas as if they are facts... For FLIPKARt I would give it A 10/10
THIS IS MY FIRST EVER DAN BROWN BOOK I HAVE EVER READ, AND IT MADE ME A BIG FAN OF DAN BROWN. A MUST READ FOR CATHOLIC'S HISTORY LOVERS. IT INTERESTS ME FROM HE VERY FIRST PAGE OF THE NOVEL. BREATHTAKING TWISTS IS ONE OF THE SPECIALITY OF THIS BOOK!!!
This is for the first time that I have read a Dan Brown. What a gifted writer! The reader of the Da Vinci Code can't help being transported in jet-speed thrill to an unimaginable destination. All the characters in the ...Code come alive with their respective sheen. They look so authentic. Fantastic book!
Very entertaining,thrilling and exiting novel.it makes your brain work and its a bit boring first 2-3 chapters but don't leave it at that time .what an extra odinary service from flipkart!!!(though I ordered it from my dad's ID)very good discount and product reaches before the time with awesome bookmark.after reading this novel i've become his big fan of Mr. Brown.don't miss it....
first 30-40 pages might seem bit confusing and slow, after that there is no break for breathing. Its one of the best thriller and detective story of all times. it will take you on a roller coaster ride through the ancient secret societies, modern cryptography, organized crime, scientific research, and many more. When you read this unputdownable book, you can feel the amount of hard work, sincerity, research done by the author. Must read for everyone.
yes . .yes . .yes!! this is the Dan brown!!! what a mind he has got!! unbelievable !!even if you don't like reading books, plz read this . . .this will surely make you fall in love with itself and . . .yes, Mr Dan Brown!!!
Dan Brown really became a master of thrillers after 'Da Vinci Code'.Hats off for his guts. This book might shock the conservative Christians.But keeping it aside it will entertain you thoroughly .It gives you different perspective or illusion .
mind blowing.. just mind blowing... hope i didnt see the movie first. but still it had no much difference.. every chapter ends with a cliff hanger... best thing is it has been a long time since i saw the movie, the memory of the story of the movie is very faint... so it was lot more interesting than the movie.. the book covered each and every, minute detail of the story... as complete one fifth of the book, i developed a special love for symbols and religious history.. da vinci is all over my brain.. symbols are all over my brain.. i started finding connection between every small incident that happens in my life.. THIS BOOK HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED MY PROSPECTIVE!!! i dont know whether the points in the story are true or not, but i prefer considering it true.. i am so involved with the story... A MUST READ!!!
only one word can be said about this book. . . 'WOW'. it worths your time.
Great Book, Gripping suspense..
