Mx Kx Gandhi - An Autobiography Or The Story Of My Experiments With Truth@@@The book gives detailed narrative of important events in Gandhi ji's life. All aspects of his life are told beautifully in his own words........the transformation from an irresponsible boy to a social worker to Mahatma is worth reading.
It's one of the most inspiring book i have ever read. don't read coz it's just an autobiography of some famous person, read it because it will show you how a young,innocent lad can rise above all and without compromising his principles, still manages to conquer the world! It's a great book with great lessons to teach! :)

Wanted to purchase this one since quote some time. Finally bought it from Flipkart, price is good and book quality is good
I was just searching some good book for knowledge for children and came across this book. Although I did not order this book from flipkart but just wanted to write a review for this as the book is really heart touching and gives opportunity to learn the life of great legend.
I finished reading this wonderful book by MKG. It is a wonderful experience that will remain by my lifetime. I kept reading this book in Delhi Metro for some 15 days and now paper leaves are coming out due to weak glue. One may go for hard cover edition. For some, font size will also appear small. Price wise it is excellent. I am thinking of getting it bound and share.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MK GANDHI IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK AND A VERY INSPIRING BOOK IT IS A VERY OPEN BOOK MK GANDHI HAS WRITTEN EVERYTHING ALL THE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES NOTHING IS HIDDEN ABOT HIM IN THIS BOOK ABOUT HIM WE ALL SHOULD READ IT ONCE AS WE ARE THE INDIANS AND HE IS THE FATHER OF THE NATION.
Every body must read the 'M.K.Gandhi - An Autobiography or The Story of My experiments with truth' to understand the Gandhian way of life for peace, harmony, kind and compassion. -S.Rajesh Khanna, The Handwriting Guru.
