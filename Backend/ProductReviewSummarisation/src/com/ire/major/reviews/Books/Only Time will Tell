Only Time will Tell@@@ITS AWESOME FOR A NEW READER. I JUST STARTED READING NOVELS CAUSE I WANT TO ENTER INTO HARVARD AND NEEDED GOOD VOCAB SO I WENT FOR THIS BOOK. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE STORY IS PHENOMENAL.
No need to write a review of Jeffrey Archer book because all know what a gr8 write he is & no doubt this book also brings out the characters & the situations clearly.
Enjoyed reading it. Lovely book and completely engaging. Go for it. It is JA at its best and the characters are engaging and the book is un-putdownable.
A real page turner.....couldn't keep the book down. Terrific thriller. Takes us to a different era and makes us live in that time till you finish reading the book.
Intricate story, full of stunning twists and turns, part one of the three book series, but the story urges you to read the other two books also. Very good read for a weekend
Hello! This was my first experience with Jeffrey Archer and I must say it was beyond expectations. JA is a master storyteller and is one of the finest I've ever read. Believe me, because this has regained my lost interest in reading. Looking forward to more titles from JA!!
I think the book has been written in an entertaining and engaging manner. I really enjoyed how each and every character's perspective is depicted and how slowly and effectively the entire story unfolds. The description of Harry Clifton's early life of how he manages to get the scholarship and the ordeal he has to go though every morning has been presented quite elaborately and gives a wonderful feel of living through the tough time of 1920's. I did not like the end of the book. I think the tempo in which the story speeds up was great but the climax was not what i expected it to be and was rather disappointing. But overall a great book and i enjoyed reading it.
The book set was a gift for someone special and was bought at a very short notice. Must tap Flipkart's back for its timely delivery.
This is one of the best novels from Jeff Archer, all the characters are sensible the plot is cool too.. when you'll start reading this novel you will experience the story yourselves you will fall in love with this one... a must buy.Go for it !
A very nice book with extra-ordinary plot and story. You can not leave it once started. A touching and mind blowing reading experience from beginning to end. The characters are so lively that you can get easily lost with them through the lanes of Bristol. An unforgettable journey with little Harry Clifton to his mysterious course of life!
This is the second Jefferey Archer that i have read and i must say i can see a pattern emerging; I absolutely love his books !!!!!!!!!! I loved his writing style, it really does keep you hooked on to the book. Not once did i get bored reading this book neither did i have to force myself through it. Do pick it up and give it a read and i will end it there as i dont want to include any spoilers !!!!
Its definitely the best book I have ever read. Definite page turner. Well connected and Superb . Every character is interesting especially Old Jack and Emma. Of course Harry Clifton. You cannot predict anything what about the next episode, that's the BEST part of the book. Enjoy guys!!!
Officially attended the launch of this book in Mumbai...So was quite excited to finally read it..Read an Archer after a long time..& boy was it worth the wait...!!! A masterfully told story in the classic Archer style..Great characters...wonderfully built..Only time will tell will leave you wanting for more..I am headed for the next book..recommend this highly if you haven't read it..Buy it..You will not be disappointed.. Bravo..for the quick delivery & great packing..Keep it up..!!!
An absolute must read, this book is one of the most enthralling ones I've come across. You just don't want this journey to end... there are some intense moments that'll leave you breathless. and FYI- Flipkart did a great job... delivered within 24 hours! epic. Good going, guys.
this was my first jeffery archer book...and i must tell the viewers that one should buy it without any hesitation ..but beware as you might get emotionally attached to the characters of this book.be it the special bond b/w hary,giles &denkins as friend or the super devilish HUGO ,or the ever sacrificing mother mrs clifton.... This book is a must read who all like the perfect family saga and thriller....
Only time will tell is a great book.This book is the perfect start for the Clifton chronicles. Jeffery Archer in this book has described the story of the central character Harry in a beautiful way . This book if described in best way then it can be said that this book is totally UNPUTDOWNABLE. This book is so good that that if its 2nd part is not bought then the story will continously buzz in our head CONCLUSION:- GO FOR IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just love those family sagas. And the Clifton Chronicles are excellent. Jeffrey Archer didnt disappoint me. Having said that, you cant just read one.... its like a soap opera... you just have to read the next one as well - Sins of the Father
this is a very nice book, this is my first from archer.. each and every charecter in this book is well described... and most amazing part in this book is narration.. you will find it very intresting and i also bought it`s next part.. a must try...
It was a very interesting read. The plot was well crafted and I could't put down the book until I had read every page. It was rich in its literary value and narrating style. I was disappointed by the way the book had ended quite abruptly but then I discovered it had a sequel so I am going to read that book.
I am not a voracious reader i have not read many books of foreign writer this is my second or third book but I can't stop thinking about it. This book made me write my second review every character of this book feels more than real story is just good the way it is narrated could not have been better than. My five stars goes to this book. worth of every paisa i spent on it..... dont think just buy it
Clifton chronicles is again the best work by Jeffrey Archer who kept his thrill, that tantalizes your senses, going, infact multiplying, till the 400th page. This book in particular has been a wonderful start. One that is more catchy for me in this novel compared to all other novels is the style of narration. All the characters have been given equal importance & narrated in a superb fashion N I luv that!! ::::: A Must Read :::::
A good read!! Not as exciting as Archer's other books like Kane & Abel etc... Once I started, i simply couldn't put it down till I finished it. Looking forward to reading the next book in the Clifton Chronicles, 'The Sins of The Father'.
well done job by Jeffery!! wow its an awesome book n best part about the book is it gives the insight story from all the important characters of the book.. enjoyed reading every bit of the book..!
Only Time Will Tell- after many many days was i ever blown away by a book like this!! my first ever Jeffery Archer book. I had much read about Mr. Archer's magic as a writer and i selected the book randomly not knowing what to expect and boy oh boy that book exceeded my expectations. Its so engrossing that i was unable to close the book even for a minute..... Read it in 3 hours straight!!! An absolute page turner and the cliff hanger at the end was one of the best i have ever read!!!! Cant wait to get my hands on the second book of the Cliffton Chronicles-The Sins of the Father and get over the suspense. For all the book worms out there if you have not started the Cliffton Chronicles, you are really missing out on something wonderful and for those who don't read- try to read it... believe me you wont be disappointed!!! And as always prompt delivery by Flipkart!!!
NO need to describe how the book is, is the book good i would reply back "Just Buy And Read It" and yes don't forget the continuation of this novel "The sins Of The Father". But one thing i found a bit boring was sometimes the story description gets receptive again and again as it lead to introduction of the characters. besides that plot is good writing is excellent story is wonderful.
- To tell in a single word, this book is awesome. Once you start reading it, you cannot keep it down before completing it. After reading this book, I became a fan of Jeffrey Archer. - This is the first part of Clifton Chronicles. Don't forget to read the sequel "The Sins of the father", which you would never put it down either - This book is to be cherished forever. - The book is delivered within 3 days with great packaging. And the book is in great quality. Love this book!!!!
This is book has a decent storyline and partly intriguing. Also written a very simple language, can be completed very fast. The only shocking point is that it is part of a three book series which i got to know when i finished this book. I was disappointed as i had to buy an other book to continue the story. The story is not worth 3 books i felt.
This is my first review in flipkart!!!! This Book is a real Page turner!!!!! Remained glued to the book from the first page till the end!!! A perfect amalgamation of multifarious emotions!!!! Jeffrey Archer ROCKS!!!!!!
My first of Jeffery Archer's. Best part of the novel was very boring. Maybe, I am not the one who liked Drama. But then, the plot and the narration was pretty new to me. Indeed, authors don't stop to surprise me. There is a story of this book and a few characters in the story. The story is told in different character's point of view, till, at the end the reader doesnt have any doubt about the whole story. Every nook and corner is revealed. But it gets on the nerve to read the same story repeated more then thrice! It might be from different ponit of views, but seriously it is damn boring. There is a large part of the story when I felt like just giving up the books. If not for good ratings on Goodreads, I would've given up this book, long ago. And I don't regret it. Infact, I would've regretted if I would've given up the book, before I completed it. The best part of the whole story is first part and the last part. Especially, the last part was more exciting than the whole book combined. Can't wait to read get my hands on the second book - The sins of the father...
Honestly, it has been a year since I read this book, so am a little hazy. Flipkart delivery had been great (yeah I remember, because never once did I _not_ have great service :) ) And the bookmarks with every book. Amazing touch. It is the little things like this, that matter. Shows us that they care about their customers. [Note: this was in 2011] Book was a great page turner. At the end of the book, I was like "When is the next book coming out?". Next year?? Kidding me? Print Quality: Paper was average. Font size is reasonable. It has been on my shelf for > 1year. Paper hasn't changed colour. And I don't get the allergic feeling on opening the book after one year :) . So all in all decent. Cost (Value for money): Hmm, has gotten more expensive since I bought it. I got it from Rs 200, which was a deadly price. It is a early 2011 book. Just about Rs30 expensive. For 200 it is a deadly buy. Although, not reading it means you lose out on a great series. Yes, this is book 1 in what might be a series of 5 books. At the time of this review (2012) book 2 was also out. Just Google around to find out which the next book is. Finally: Is this book supposed to be Tasted/Swallowed/Digested: Swallowed. You can't miss stuff in the book, you need to read it thoroughly. Ask yourself the occasional question "What would I have done?". "Some books are meant to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; That is, some books are to be read only in parts; Others to be read, but not curiously; And some few to be read wholly, and with dilligence and attention." -Francis Bacon, Of Studies
Have finished reading Only time willl tell and Sins of the father and seriously cant wait for the 3rd book... Jeffrey Archer is one of my fav authors and some of my fav books are Kane and Abel , Sons of Fortune , Prisoner Of Birth and the Clifton Series..
This was my first book of Jeffrey Archer. It amazed me to the core.. Mr. Archer has written it so very well.Let how many ever books i have ever read, this is gonna be the best book ever!!! I hope I too had a friend like Old Jack... I never wanted the book to end!!!!! I just loved all the characters that come in the story... the story takes so many twists and turns like a roller coaster... Last but not the least, the climax was just unbelievable!!!!
Brilliant work by jeffrey archer. The way he takes the story b/w the persons, its really worth reading this book. Thanks for flipkart for delivering ontime. Great work.
this book is based on the lives of two families, who are connected to each other in a very unexpected way.each character is defined in a very different way, which is good. but its mostly about Harry Cliffton and the mystery about the death of his father. this book is a prolonged drama to find out what happened to the father. it keeps u turning the pages but when you reach the part of revelation there is nothing amusing or surprising. at the end, the book is just bout a rich n poor family and how Harry's mother gets him educated. and you have to wait to see, now what happens to harry cliffton in the second book.
you the truth. So just keep on sucking until the last drop reaches your lips... must you read friends... I suppose, Jeffrey could've skipped some events and facts and descriptions. But I realize, why Jeffrey is called a good storyteller. Incidents happen on. But the way to make them incidents is quite difficult. That hard job is not even harder to Jeffrey.
Very typical writing. Not very thrilling either. Story-line is good. Writing and descriptions of situations and places could have been better. My Reco- Read, if you are an Archer fan or if you have nothing better to read.
This is the first Jeffery Archer book that I read and it didn't fail to make me his fan. After this book, I bought some of his previous works (Kane and Abel) and loved those too. The characters in this story are not super heroes; they do not come from a legendary fictional tale, they are just simple, subtle human beings who lived in early 20th century in the British city of Bristol. They are so life like, they seem almost real to the reader. Harry, Emma, Giles, Hugo, Masie, Old Jack, Mr. Holcombe, each and every character has their special place in the story. None of them is neglected or overly emphasized. It truly is a story of two families. Its a story of great friendship between Harry, Giles and Deakins. Its also a story of love between Harry and Emma. Overall, this book is really entertaining and in the end you wouldn't want it to end. Same is the case with the next book in the series, The Sins of the Father. It continues from exactly where this book left so read this one first.
it's amazing how the guy does it again and again,the story begins with the life of harry clifton and his family and the barringtons.Jeffrey archer maintains the suspense and keeps us to keep hooked throughout.Great book for the bucks,and it will be sometime before Harry goes off your mind!
There is nothing new in this novel but it a decent timepass, it entertains the reader in bits and pieces, the protaganist Harry is sustained by his mother who does everything to make sure he recieves the best and she does succeeds in that, then there is Jack Harry's beloved mentor who guides him to success and the badman Mr. Hugo- well he is the villian trying everything to tarnish harry and his mother and the reason - READ THE NOVEL FOR THAT
this is the worst book of MR. archer. the story revolve on same topic narrated by different characters. it seem to be that jeffery has in short of story plots....i cant gather the courage to read it after 190 page....... a real headache
Overwhelmed by the story and representation from everyone's stand point. First time I read the Clifton series and touched by heart. Archer is a great story teller I must say, it seems everything happening in front of my eyes. This series has mystery, romance, sacrifices of a mother and great lover also ups and downs of Harry's life. It would not allow you to stop reading. Enjoy the Clifton series.
I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Jeffrey Archer's earlier works - I was not able to put down the books till I had read the last page. But this one was different - it was a drag and I kept waiting for some turn or twist to happen, but there wasn't any. And when I was somehow done with reading the novel, the story is not complete. Why? Because Jeffrey Archer wants you to read his next book. Don't waste your time!
A beautifully written book, narrating a story which is so beautiful.really a very good book to read...A Sharing of pain. A gravitation between two bodies whose dwelling souls have been involved in sharing something so painful that they have become oblivious of their physical existence and their bodies. A spiritual sharing in which one surrenders everything one owns, to another, just to share the pain which has been flowing deep inside him. Pain- which has failed to diminish with time. And which has only grown in size and projection. A tender story that deserves to be listened tenderly.i would say a must read for everyone who love reading novels...
This book and clifton saga reminded me of a popular soap (one tree hill) as i went through in the initial chapters and in the latter half of a Indian movie. So if I mix a daily soap on English channel and a Bollywood movie it gives me a cocktail which is definitely different, pleasant or not depends on the taste of the reader. Personally I was predicting everything a chapter in advance so only exciting part for me was Jeffery archer's unique story telling way. I have reluctantly purchased the next edition as well but only time will tell whether I would be interested in the saga for long
This was my first read of Jeffery Archer. Quite interesting book. I liked it!!! Harry's journey thru childhood....his likings & dislikes...his voice...hymns...days at boarding schools...higher studies...Maise's struggles at every stage of Harry's life..old jack...barrington's...It was a good experience to feel as if you lived among these people as you read.
Only Time Will tell is another excellent work from Jeffery Archer.If you read this book, you will not going to find, who time spent. Specially the portion of Harry.. Above all. I must Have to say this one of the best from Archer. Though it is not better than Ken & Abel. But still it is a Must Read..
The book was a real deal as many other works by Archer.For me i felt connected with the character at many instances in the book and advice my fellow readers to give this book a fine read.thought the book went pretty dull at some parts but the author made sure that the reader was hooked to the book with his expertise in portraying minute details with great flourish
I have to say that this is my first Jeffery Archer book and I am feeling sad that i never listened to my bro when he told me about his other works ... Its during a minor surgery break that I got a chance to read this one. And what a read !!! This is excellent work of fiction and very much of a page turner. I have to say that I kind of expected the book's general plot to take the direction that it took. Since, the work was similar to another book that I read called "The Shadow Of The Wind- By Carloz Ruiz Zafron" (another excellent work if you havent already read it!!!). But still there were so many twists that I couldnt wait to finish reading the book and order the Volume 2 (Sins of the Father). The characters are excellent my favorites in this order - Harry, Old Jack, Emma, Masie, Giles. Don't miss ... A good to have book for the fiction lovers.
Hello, I can assure all the potential readers that this is gonna be one of the best books you're ever gonna read(Mind you it is the first book of the Clifton Chronicles). Pick it up and putting it down would only be possible when you've reached the final page!! Its an amazing read!! Happy reading!! :)
If you have been a longtime Archer fan, you would have noticed the difference between Kane and Abel and Only Time Will Tell. I dont think Prodigal Daughter was a planned effort while Archer is writing a four or a five part Clifton Chronicles. The delightful sponatniety of Kane and Abel is missing in Only Time will Tell. And yet the Archer magic works! He is a master storyteller and I feel he has still not produced his best work. A compusory read for all and not just Archer followers.
This piece of work by Jeffrey archer is indeed a marvel. The book transports you into a world where time slows down and you will be gasping for even more. On purchase I read the book quite casually/ just skimming to say appropriately where the character of old jack Tarrant took me by surprise....and then completed the book in full 2 nights. Definitely a sure and must read novel....Once again thank u flipkart for lightning fast delivery.
Easily the best of Jeffery Archer, his brand of writing is completely unique makes u gasp in awe and admiration. u JUST CAN'T LET IT GO!!! A wonderful journey of a boy who tries hard to find his real identity taking everything in his stride is something that u would not like to miss.Grab your copy now..
I wont spend much of my words on Flipkart delivery and service.Excellent, to say in a word. As for the book, it is a nice Volume 1, will keep you asking for the next one.The Rich Guy - poor Guy thing definitely works for Lord Archer, the post WW1 UK is nicely depicted. The Central characters are given equal importance as the story unfolds in different layers. Suggested for all Archer fans as well as for someone who wants to start from somewhere :-)
This novel is definitely a good novel with its share of good moments and characters, but it's not a masterclass and not in the same league as Honour among thieves and another Archer i personally enjoyed, A Prisoner of Birth, its not even in the same country, let alone league. The characters fail to connect, basically because of the lack of depth in the book, which is due to the fact that its a 5 book series. Sir Jeffrey could have added more character to the characters and made it a smaller series.
A very very unique story and the story does not end here. It ends with such tragic story that reader will ask for more. Also read the 2nd part. Jeffery Archer is really the no.1 bestseller. The character harry clifton is really interesting to know and his love for emma is really very sweet.
Excellent work by Mr Archer. It was a magnificent depicted story and never felt bored throughout. Tom Bradshaw was an excellent twist at the end and looking forward to get my hands on "Sins of the father".. Thank you sir!!
U will be amazed after reading the melody of J.A. The presentation is done in such a manner that u just want to dive in and go on and on.............. I recommend it as a must read. Don't miss out much coz its the best work by the best story teller.
I really liked the way Archer started the story and kept the pace.It was little bit different approach the way he narrated the story ,different from his previous books.It has all the elements that one expects from Jeffrey Archer.
For all the Jeffry Archer that I have read till now, one this is common, after one point the book seems like a Bollywood movie with a predictable end. However this book turned out to be Hollywood movie with a totally unpredictable end...and that's when I realized that it a part 1 of the 5 part series. I immediately logged on to the system to order the next part realizing it is expected mid- march 2012. Will surely Order it. Overall nicely written book. Will give a 4 star. You can compare it to Kane and Able ... Read it ... you'll enjoy it. Nitin "
It takes one by storm how Jeffrey Archer expounds the characters pretty well in a little soggy plot. The plot of the book get's a bit predictable and indolent at some parts. But how Archer has beautifully put together characters in this book is truly remarkable. In the end, Plot turns out to be average. But towards the end, it does leave a mind full of question and answers. Waiting for the sequel, The sins of the Father eagerly. :)
I Received Only time will Tell from flip-kart.Its been packed well and received it in good condition.If you start reading this i bet its hard to put it down.Overall I enjoyed very much reading this.I recommend everyone to buy this and will be a great add to your books collection.
Although I can recall 3 other stories in which the child was absolute hero and go-getter and brain-wise, still, the writing style kept me glued till end. The archer-style is that of suspense in last line that make you want to read next chapter/book. Off course, the usual "inspirational" stuff is there and some very neat dialogues. Heart touching characters and very believable twists make this story archer-delightful. Jeffrey keeps his promise of entertainment with soul-searching. At least I am waiting for 15 march 2012 to get next part of Clifton-chronicles.
Old bottle, new wine - but tasty however. Right from the start, Archer keeps everyone hooked to the story and the characters. The last line of the book is sure to make readers pre-order the sequel; I will and on Flipkart only - cant beat Flipkart !
Excellent and must read.. You would really forget the time when reading this book. Absolute page turner.. Waiting for the sequel. You would be with the characters even after the end of the book.. Such is the influence of the characters on you. Every character gives you a deep insight of life and its importance.
the most brilliant piece of work from Jeffrey Archer. Amazing way of telling a story through the passage of time through the different protagonists. It has the classic end notes of Archer at the close of a chapter which reminds us of his style. There is seamless movement from first person narrative to the third person and consistent thread in the story through the characters. I will be the first to pick up the rest of the chronicle series and am eager to see how the master storyteller weaves his magic. Very highly recommended.
The book has a very good start. The very first chapter made us think what this book contains. The book became a very good read till the proposed marriage of Harry. But after that the book became slow and i thought the author has elongated the story beyond necessity. The recital of events from different characters is sure a fine done. The book is a good time pass.
I am a huge Archer fan. This book started off well with the usual twists and turns. But the end was a total disappointment. Especially those who have read his other books like Not a penny more not a penny less, kane and abel etc will find that this pales in comparison. Not a book I will recommend
Guys don't just assume this masterpiece as a single story novel. This gem is among the first of the novels(5 novels) in "Clifton Chronicles". Jeffrey Archer started this series aiming to dazzle & pump the extra adrenaline in to the readers as they have experienced never before. I am sure you will like this masterpiece from the master himself in story telling. Great book ( for first part ). You will start cursing "Jeffrey" after reading the last page for the suspense he has created and for delaying to release his second book. Guys don't forget to follow the second book which is scheduled for March 2012 release .
this book is seriously awesome . i think if some pictures should will be added so it get much better.
I was one of the few lucky people who got to meet Jeffrey Archer in person at the book launch of Only Time Will Tell in Delhi. I remember him telling all his fans that The Clifton Chronicles will be his most ambitious project ever and to be honest, the guy has done everything a writer can to make a novel worth reading. Archer has come up with a fantastic plot and has lived up to the expatiation of his fans. If you are looking for a genuinely entertaining novel then read Only Time Will tell. You'll enjoy reading it.
Excellent book from Jeffry Archer...!!Really this author is amazing....
A work of art... I began reading this about an hour after its delivery and i put it down not more than five times...though it cost me an entire day and an entire night. Archer changes the very definition of a shocking ending with this the first part of Clifton Chronicles. I must say 20 years never zoomed past this fast before. Caution : An extremely engaging read, DO NOT read during your examination time. Oh and flipkart rocks..it was delivered a day later in such a secure packaging that it took me almost half an hour to open it up!!!
This my first experience with Jeffrey Archer's and I'd say it was very awesome. He holds your hand and takes you to every place he intended to travel in the story. The way he impersonate everyone in the story is simply superb and makes you to feel like you're also one of them. I'm waiting eagerly for the next sequel of the Clifton Chronicles. If you're a classic person then this book will make you mind blowing.
wow its an awesome book n best part about the book is it gives the insight story from all the important characters of the book.. enjoyed reading every bit of the book..!
Announcing a five part series and delivering it one book at a time is a bad idea. The end of book one leaves u deeply disappointed. The narrative also jerks back and forth and the style is repetitive and reminiscent of so many earlier novels. Before part two is out, may I venture to predict that the unborn child would not be colour blind? Q.E.D.
Quite a good book from Jeffrey but i would say its not a master piece.Found the book very interesting but the climax is very disappointing.Worth reading.Don't bother to read the last page.If there's a sequel iam eagerly waiting!!
"only time will tell" leaves you wondering we are so much at mercy with time..awaiting for the sequel, desperately...to know further what will happen to 'Tom Bradshaw's' fate..will he meet his mother...is his child alive and how did Emma brought up the child...and the most imp...THE TRIAL.. Hope the sequel is out soon to answer all the curiosity...
the novel is pretty good. I enjoyed reading this novel. The writing is mind blowing. But the thing that disappointed me is its endings.
first of all.. flipkart is amazing!!!! i ordered dis book yesterday night! n received it today evening..less dan 24 hours.. awesome work!! n the book is in an awesome state..all packed n nicely done..i am loving this site!
first thing first. This is the book from the master story teller of our time. Archer like his books kane and abel sketches the story of clifton from his life as a young lad to his teen age. considering this book is the first in clifton chronicles the appeal of the book is natural. we dont feel like keeping the book down. What is even more amazing is the way archer tells the story. sketchin from a lifetime a simple story from the eyes of all the people in the story. something which archer rarely does. still to all those ardent jeffrey archer readers this is a must read.Cant wait for the sequel to come
I read the book. It's a good one but not as good as his before ones. It is a different book coz it is told in different charecters view point. Overall Old Jack Tar is the best Charecter. It is a good read. It is worth 195 buying in flipkart but not worth 325 bucks
I finished this book in one day, i cannot leave even 5 mins .. must read to all the people who loves to read a good novels...the ending makes me thinking what will be the next book from the author.....
ill keep try and keep this short and sweet unlike the reviews above or below(depending where this turns up).....the book is extremely intriguing right from the start where different characters try and put the pieces of the puzzle together....ull race through the entire book hoping for a classic "Jeffrey archer" bigger then life ending...and all u get is a BIG SPLAT!!!.....cudnt have been more incomplete, unimaginative and cliched. Even though Kane and Abel was a trilogy each book of the series had its own definitive ending which this book lacked beyond measure. I would say read through 99.9 percent of this book and keep the book away before you turn the last page as it is going to be sorely disappointing....
Another masterpiece from Jeffrey Archer. His vivid deccriptions, his immaculate character sketch, his unique style of narration and finally an unpredictable end-----all these make Archer the brilliant writer that he is. This book is no exception. The idea of unfolding the story from the point of view of the different major characters is brilliant. Even though the storyline is not anything extraordinary, the impressive delivery makes it special. a must read for all Archer lovers and for those who have not read Archer.
Two things are actually quite clear from this novel - 1. Jeffrey Archer is undoubtedly the master of impersonation!! Half his novels – including Sons of Fortune, A Prisoner of Birth and this one – are based on the same Impersonation formula which has ruled Bollywood for decades! 2. This book is obviously an outcome of the immense success J K Rowling has had with Harry Potter. The idea of making a series instead of a standalone novel, the break-up of the book into different part’s of the protagonist’s life, and even the name of the hero – Harry Clifton – are an indirect ode to the fabulous Potter series. But that does not mean Only Time Will Tell is not brilliant! It is great to see Archer at the top of his form once again – after the forgettable Prisoner of Birth and False Impression. Only Time Will Tell has been announced as a five-part compilation, and i’m already waiting for the next instalment of Harry Clifton’s life. In choosing the location for the story, Archer picked his own hometown – of Weston-Super-Mare, and he has absolute grasp over the region, its culture, its history and all the quirks that are so peculiar to British Life. Since the book begins at in the 1920s, there are even more of them! Archer is masterful in guiding us through the life of Harry – from when he is five years old to when he turns 20 and the book ends. Only Time will Tell is bound to be a masterpiece – and not just in scope. The story and its characters are brilliantly sculpted – like in all of Archer’s books, but the real mastery here is the multiple narrative that the author chooses over a linear variant like he normally prefers. Each part of the book is told through a different character, and they all weave in beautifully. It is immensely satisfying to step alternately into the shoes of Harry, Old Jack Tarrant, Hugo Barrington, Emma, and Mrs. Clifton in turn, and to the author’s credit, the story never slackens – even when the narrator changes. There is something magical about all novels written around the sea and ships, and this one is no different. Life near the docks has its own romance, and every page in the novel bears testimony to that. There are a few twists and turns that are predictable – especially to Archer fans who’ve gobbled up everything written by the master. But still the book doesn’t bore us and makes us read through at a go. The story of the first part begins at the end of the first world war and at the start of the second. That gives the second book a completely different premise and in Archer’s hands, it is bound to shine – as did all his earlier novels of the period. I’m already looking forward to the second one, and hope it comes out soon – and not like Harry Potter which came out once a year! Welcome back, Mr.Archer!!
The ending is much disappointing. I don't understand why Harry took a decision to change his identity.
The latest by Mr archer is a gripping tale, but the end of the story was a let down. but till the last page its a damn good read!!!
I am an ardent fan of Archer. This book is quite interesting but not as interesting as Kane and Abel. The story is fast paced and written in a beautiful language. The friendship between Harry and Giles is commendable. Though the narration is good there are lot of loose ends in the story line. The ending is quite abrupt and it gives an insatiable feeling. Needless to say that this book is definetly worth reading. If there is a sequel... then i am eagerly waiting for it...
Just believe in what you do, time leads you through... It made me believe in fate, start searching for childhood friends and all those people whom I believed not working up to their ability in life, hence end up taking worthless job. I realized its not their mistake. A mother ready to do anything in life to see his son reach a status in society, a son adoring his mother and ready to fulfill his mother's dream at any cost, friends not just staying by the side in the days of turmoil but walk towards you to defend from any kind or level of catastrophe, and finally life partner, you simply have to read it to know. I mourned the fate of Clifton's adviser Jack, really it was unexpected. There are many questions lingering as what happened to Hugo Barrent, how's Clifton's mother feeling now, what else fate has in stock for Harry in NY??? cant wait for sequel any longer, Please hurry up.
|Firstly, hats Off to Flipkart Service - Book was in my hands within two days of order and not to be outdone - I finishesd the book in one and a half day. A vintage Archer - beautiful language - gripping with typical JA touches. However, at many places, the situations are rather laboured and look artificial or very simplistic - hope that in the Volumes to come, we will have the real Archer.
Amazing service by flipkart...... i got my order within 1 n half day day almost......... and about the book : its just minblowing, its with full of excitement in every line i read till now.........
I ordered the book on friday morning and got it delivered by flipkart the very evening. Talk about quick service. Once I started reading it I simply couldnt put the book down. Jeffrey Archer keeps the reader in suspence throughout the entire book. He takes the minutest details and turns it into interesting series of events. This book is typical Jeffrey Archer and catches him at his finest.
That is the exact feeling you are left with at the end of the book. Very abrupt end to an otherwise good tale. It does get repetitive at times since its the same story being told from a different view points. I am an Archer fan but this one kind of let me down.
I begin with sayin, i was/am/and ever will be an ardent archer fan. For those who have read kane and abel and sons of fortune, will find this book have a similar storyline in the beginning. But what makes this novel stand apart from them is the way archer said story, how ppl who lead different lives sees the things happening around them. To add to this, a typical archer's book with a half a dozen twists, which adds its part to keep the page turning. For ppl who havnt read any of archer's till now, this turns out to be a MUST READ. But for the ARCHER FANS, they wont find this mindblowing like KANE AND ABEL, THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT etc. To summarize, this book, as all of the archer's, is an excellent page turner with a superb end which makes us long for whats gonna happen in the next part. THE GREAT ARCHER DOES IT AGAIN:) :)
