Lost Symbol, The@@@Just superb!!!! Another Dan Brown hit!!! Simply fantastic read!!! A beautiful combination of mystry, religion, science and spirituality........... it will simply make u bite ur own nails.............!!!!!
i wouldn't actually refer to this as a fiction in the strict sense. you get to know a hell lot of facts... and certainly some are totally not required. also the book seems to drag it self at some parts, specially during particular conversations and during the end. Dan Brown, being an excellent story teller no doubt, beats around the bush... a lot in this one. for those who are sternly against didactic reads, do not opt for THE LOST SYMBOL. on the bright side, the book is pretty informative and i must say, the author does manage to veil the extremely dramatic climax and not once did i get a hint of the on-comings! the book throws light on hush-hush historical truths of America and the one disclaimer at the beginning of the book will throw you off guard (especially if you have missed it at the beginning at read it after you finish the book- which i did :P) Dan Brown blends fact and fiction perfectly as usual, with a very few drawbacks which can be overlooked easily.
nice read twist and turn in every chapter.................................... one should read if you are a Dan Brown fan
Dan Brown is great as usual, i gifted it to somebody and they gave me a pretty good review about the book, saying book's on 3rd favorite Dan Brown book!
I mean like seriously. How does he manage to write such awesome books? This book completely blew my mind, just like the previous ones did. Robert Langdon, US Capitol, the Freemasons, you got the gist. This is one complete mind-blower. I highly recommend this book. Coming to Flipkart's even more awesome service, I ordered two other books along with this. They got delivered in 3 days. The packaging was as usual, flawless. And I simply love the small bookmarks that Flipkart drops in. Competitive price too. Where else would you find 43% discount (unless, of course, any relative of your's owns a shop). I'd say, grab it ASAP. And be prepared to spend a lot of time on this mind-boggler. Kudos.
Super cool characters, awesome locations, thrilling, spine chilling, adventure packed. Robert lived up to his expectations.
if u lyk novel on mystery....... dis 1 is 4 u.... u ll enjoy reading it..... i m just waitin 4 d movie based on dis novel (as da vinci code & angel & demons)
Dan Brown's another masterpiece. Really thrilling. But i think he has to give Robert Langdon some rest
It was nowhere near Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, but was still unputdownable. Dan Brown never disappoints.It was not that bad as many people have pointed out.Perhaps everyone would have liked it if Dan Brown wrote this before 'Angels and Demons' and 'The Da Vinci Code'.But all the fans of Dan Brown will like this book as his other books.
Big fan of dan brown and robert langdon since The Da-vinci Code. Da vince code was a masterpiece. After reading Da-vinci code i read Angels and demons which was equally impressive. I brought Lost symbol with huge expectations and as i completed reading around 400 pages i was kicking myself for my buy. Story is very similar with not much twists. Ending of the story is a bit pale and would disappoint you if you are ardent Robert Langdon Fan People reading Dan Brown's novel for the first time might be very much impressed but those who have read da-vinci code , it is utter disappointment Rating would have been much lower if it was not a Robert Langdon Triller. 2.5 for the novel and .5 specially for Robert Langdon
Its a Good suspense thriller from Dan Brown. Langdon Rocks again.I enjoy his stories and the fantastical idea that there could be some huge conspiracy or esoterica out there that only a few people know about.This is the third book to follow Robert Langdon, a Harvard Symbologist who previously showed up in Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon), and The Da Vinci Code.
The books starts with the usual Dan Brown pace and grip. The build-up and intrigue are exactly what you expect. Towards the end, however, you realize that the big reveal is just a fizzle.
nice art ,good and very simple .hard to believe the facts he points out.stories of masons and American history as a beginner in literature I'm very impressed..........
I've read this book an year ago and i should say that this book is a page turner. It keeps you restless untill the last page. Only thing that dissappointed me was the end which could have been better. But , Dan Brown's magic works yet again. Go for it.
Enjoyed reading this book. Narration was quite good, few pages was were so good that i read them again
Shipping payment whatever stuffs we do with flipkart doesn't really matter. You have to read this book.If you'r a fan of Dan Brown,If you like a new story of adventure chasing a destiny set by others,You want to give a try for new type of book...Any one of the reasons is enough to make your mind set.....I loved this book....New book,especially a book gives a different feel of reading.....Happily got LOST!!!
This time DAN BROWN has blown you out of the face. His new book titled "THE LOST SYMBOL" is one of the best thrillers you've ever read. filled with suspense , this book will definately amaze you. The only problem with the book is that DAN BROWN has to change is writing style a little bit. If its your first DAN BROWN book then it would be mind blowing............ I say go for this one hell of a ride..........!!
As you may have seen in all previous reviews, critics has crushed Dan Brown for this novel, by comparing this with his 2 preveious masterpieces, i.e. Da Vinci Code & Angels and Demons. Is it a right stretagy to compare 5 fingers of one hand?? Can't we just enjoy the books as a separate piece?? Offcourse readers have right to expect more and more from a writer like Dan Brown but yes, after all he is also human being. I just completed the book and I must admit I am not at all disappointed. The pace is fast, the transitions between scenes/plots/chapters are smooth, though change of scene through change of chapter is not that frequent as was in Da Vinci Code. Yes, I must admit, it is a bit predictable in actions, but never reduces the gushes of Adrenaline flow. In last few pages, the book opens up one big suspense which I never predicted and still could not think of. Definitely a good mythological thriller if you are Dan Brown fan!!!! 3.5 Star
I was reading the review of others on this book, and surely not agreed to them. I mean, just get to the book and not to the criticism, for heavens sake! This was my first encounter with Mr. Dan Brown and what an experience it was! The journey starts with a call to Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon from the office of his old pal, Peter Solomon. Throughout the inevitable journey, we soon realise that the call was not an ordinary one. Moving down the arteries and veins of Washington, D.C., the whole jaw-dropping tension reveals before us a dark mystery of Freemasonry, puzzles of symbols, a pyramid that touches the sky and a staircase that goes to infinite depth, and mostly, a hidden treasure, a Lost Symbol. The whole Adrenaline-rush is to find that one thing. "What was lost will be found". Seroius readers,I assure you, the planet around you would never be the same again, you having gone through this book.
well, first point , it was not as good as previous two. nowhere near them. second, Dan Brown created so much subsets of ongoing actions into the story that at some point it all became a hodgepodge web of confusions. " readers may get lost " third, at some point Dan brown seemed to contradict/ fight with his own plot he put to create the base of the story, which made the book complex. although i cant specify or recall if there are any such facts except one - why d hell did sato chose langdon over bellamy when she flew from kalorama heights to the house of the temple???? clearly bellamy was a 33rd degree mason as stated initially in the book and he knew the ways in house of temple better than langdon. so why d hell he just waited in malakh's house with katherine. where as langdon was never been to the upper room below oculus as described. another, why malakh thought that peter would kill him to stop data transmission and save katherine, i mean even if he would kill him, he cudnt save katherine. finally, dan brown seemed to struggled in the ending with the story, the last few pages were full of limitless preachings. it seemed like Dan bROWN wanted to preach us a lecture on god, bible, and mind which he did through this book. the plot was not that impressive except introduction of some bizarre twists in story to maintain the hold. the story presentation in the end was not good and boring. I am clearly not impressed by the story, but the message it revealed about human mind's ability, and else was kinda cool... P.S. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON IT IF U R EXPECTING A DAMN THRILLING STORY, THE BOOK IS MORE FOCUSSED ON ITS PREACHINGS/ MESSAGE it wants to give RATHER THAN STORY AS I SEE IT.
Assisted with Google Maps & Images this is one more bests of Dan Brown!! The facts are all supportive in the plot and real. Lots of new secret/unknown things to be known. Although the story was very very mesmerizing and interesting thriller, the climax was not as expected and boring...atleast for me. Its a very good pass time book. The pages are not of high quality but decent enough. Delivery was perfect as always.
If you like Dan's previous novels you might not like this one as it just too much philosophical and unsatisfactory
The book is quite okay. However the story structure is similar to The Da Vinci Code & Angels and Demons. I felt that these are more interesting than The Lost Symbol. However one gets a lot of information about the Masons which is presented in an interesting way
A fast paced novel with predictable twists similar to his earlier books. I had heard negative reviews about this book but having read all Dan Brown's earlier works purchased and though i found it similar to his earlier works, must say it's quite interesting.
I was very eager to read tthis, I received it in time at a very affordable cost. I also came to know more about flip kart. Only one thing I could not adjust is the font size of this book is very small
Just downloaded it, have started only the third chapter as I write this review, but already enchanted...kudos Dan Brown for the work and Flipkart for bringing it across to me...
One of the finest of Dan Brown...That is what comes in mind when you ask to review these books...Robert Langdon didit again...Beautiful and passionate symbological meaning...just love to read it on and on...
Again Dan Brown holds the pace of this novel, But the mal'akh character is so predictable. Ending is not upto the mark, Dan creates the hype in the starting of the novel about the issue,But doesn't finish with the same.....
After reading Da Vinci Code,Deception Point and Angels & Demons......certainly you expect a lot from this author.But once you start reading its total letdown.It seems like its just another replica of Vinci Code.Like the same in Vinci Code, here also things, situations and secrets are over anticipated only to realize at the end that all you are saving for is a Bible like in Vinci Code it was the Family of Jesus.Still in Vinci Code there was thrill which totally lacks in here.You can easily predict everything......Total letdown couldnt xpect this from Dan Brown spclly after reading Angels & Demon and Deception Point.Still Angels & Demons remains as my fav Dan brown novel.
The book cover is good and the quality of the ages are good . The price for this book is just right . The delivery was pretty much good . The book's by Dan Brown are always good and thrilling, it not easily predicted what may happen or is it the end .Great service by flipkart .
The Lost Symbol... we are lost in our own world but the words of Dan ask us to come back and see the real world:) The Story as usual a great thriller starting from the strange mirage of a symbol lost and the person who is trying to get that making our hero to go everywhere where he actually dont want to go;) Hope you will also like a book like this:)
Mr. Brown perhaps created a great plot, but while reading this book, you will often get lost in the encyclopaedic texts. Here are the pros and the cons. Pros:- 1. Read this book for just one only one character- Mala'kh, the villain of the novel. 2. The climax (or perhaps, I should say anticlimax) is great. I should reccomend someone to read this book for the huge anticlimax. 3. You'll get to know a lot about the ancient history of USA. 4. I'll not say much - just read Chapter 15 and you'll get amazed. Cons:- 1. Sometimes, you'll get bored. This does not happen in 'Angels and Demons' or 'The Da Vinci Code'. 2. A part in which Robert Langdon will experience afterlife is very boring. 3. The novel is elongated by using different tactics at the end.
After reading Da Vinci Code and Digital Fortress back-to-back, I was sick of the monotonous plotting style and have given a long gap to read Dan Brown. But this book made me realize I did miss reading Dan Brown. The positives of this book is that it contains all the signature ingredients of Brown's work like crypts, science & technology, covert groups and their rituals, conspiracies, religion & mankind etc that are perfectly organized in a high paced race against time chase. Unfortunately, the same goes with the cons. Though the author tried to play his cards a bit differently from his previous works (which is actually a big relief), one can still feel the prosaic narration containing 1 villain, 1 secret, 1 hero fighting against many odds to decipher the truth. Added to that, the awesome progress of deciphering the codes leading to an disproportionally interesting destiny subsides the thrill. And the attempt Mr.Brown makes to prove his point adds 60 odd pages that are mostly redundant and feel draggy at the end.
Perfect 5 star! Lost Symbol is no doubt, more predictable than other Dan Brown books, but this one was also amazing in terms of plot and thrill... The book is awesomely penned and deserves a definite 5/5!
I love reading and this book was just Like a drug to me...It made me read even more..Dan Brown has done it again..Beautiful supspense..totally breath taking...and the book was beautiful too..I love the bookmark flipkart sends with the books..Keep it up Flipkart..
I feel this is also a good one from Mr. Brown, As it is from the same Author the way of writing might be kind of same but as per the Topic he selected, he did very good research and povide amazing facts with nice plot.
First of all kudos flipkart, delivery hardly took any time. I read this book quite some time back and rented it to my friend which i never got back again haha. So, it was like meeting an old friend again. Beautiful Novel. Must read.
The background of the Story-line is good and interesting, but too much pedantry by Dan Brown let it down. Reading this book I found that several times the pace of the story has come to an abrupt halt and description of the circumstances dominated over it, which indeed drove a patient reader like me nuts. It's like Dan have tried to show that how much information he has acquired about Washington D C (both History and Geography) rather than trying to write down a fiction. In short, it is more like a guide book rather than a thriller story.
A page turner, but did not have the kick that other novels from Dan Brown have. As compared to other Langdon mysteries, this one doesn't entice the reader as the story unfolds. However, the novel is a good read. Dan Brown's forte :).
Good book from Dan Brown! Great Plot and suspense. Awesome narration. But a bit less thrilled comparing with Angels and Daemons and DaVinci code. But great Book yet! Shipping was fast and book was in great Condition. Thanks to Flipkart!
ssly, the best book ever... the story goes on an on leading to a huge climax................. heart racing................. even better than da vinci code...............! the thrill that you get is like awesome..!
the exciting journey and a great unique story telling technique. that was a.... WOW at the end, a simple and splendid way to tell the humanity its true potential in a non controversial way. thank you flipkart i enjoyed the book a lot.
After delivering a super-thriller Da Vinci Code Brown shoots up the expectations of a reader picking up his next flick. Sadly, the reader is let down by the plot and the climax of the story. Ultimately The Lost symbol comes out to be a well known fact among the people, a simple fact upon which such huge suspense was being build up in the book. Its very irritating when your suspense ends up in vain as you conclude the novel on a stupid climax. The book is worth noticing the villain ..which has been the cruelest antagonist introduced by Brown. Urge to all not to go for this one.
IF you already read any of the Dan Brown's book you will see it follow the same plot..other books have sufficient mix of mistry, information and speed to keep your mind away form known structure of the novel and kept you reading..but this have tooooooooo much information which sometime irrelevant..very slow.. so if you already read any other Dan Brown novel..this will be a huge let down but if this is your first then you won't be as disappointed as I am. Flipkart as usual AWESOME in every aspect.. delivered this book (along with one more) within 24 hrs...
This book is not at all to the level of Angels & Demons let alone the legendary Da Vinci Code....As usual the is interesting, but though interesting is slow and the end i.e. the Climax is not at all Dan Brown 'style'.. It is very predictable..Should be bought only by hard core Dan Brown fans who want to complete his collection.. If you haven't read it is not a big loss.....
Hi Friends!........I have read all the books written by Mr.Brown. Even this book is too good!I am very much fascinated of symbols, and once again Mr Robert Langdon proved excellent in this book. One must read !.....
Dan Brown's releases are anticipated with the same enthusiasm as that of Mrs. Rowling's.... The Lost symbol,like its predecessors,reflects the magnitude of Dan Brown's research on symbolism and pagan worship. Gripping story and a thrilling adventure. This span of 24 hours of Rob Langdon's life,have enough thrills to last for a lifetime of the reader's !!!!! Must Read
After reading many mixed reviews about the book, read it at last. An engaging story and it engages each and every page. A good thriller but the story ended all of the sudden and this disappointed many. If you are fan of Dan Brown then you'll like it. But don't expect it with any of his previous works. Read it. You'll enjoy it. As usual, all of Dan Brown's elements are there in this book too and as usual contains many minute details. The book talks about ancient science and also how advanced our science were even before these modern science arrived. Don't get distracted with poor reviews. You may miss a good thriller. Last One word about The Lost Symbol: Unputdownable.
I have read the book from a friend, and its just awesome. Unbelievably fast and good theme as well as breathtaking secrets, treasures and a nice array of characters. The psychological situations and the in-depth knowledge of various masonic rituals, artifacts, architecture and their treasured knowledge surely is Dan Brown at his best.The book is a pretty good read, and I am sure that you will enjoy it too. As for me, I have ordered it for my collection..............
Had huge expectations from Dan Brown..After Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons...Sadly..the plot is too boring and dull..throws in a bit surprise here and there...Huge mystery revelation at the end..But then..It just goes on and on..More of a Lost way for Dan Brown..rather than a Lost Symbol..!
The book is awesome. The Climax !!!! I dont want to spoil any one. More Psychotic villain than Dark knight and Ultimate Twist you have never seen before !. Dont read wikipedia spoilers. Read the Book or Watch the upcoming Movie.
The book contains nothing but unwanted history that has almost nothing to do with the plot. I read angels and demons the novel was something with suspense,technology,history that correctly added to the plot,a novel which gav every bit of entertainment, and i would sadly say that this one doesnt give anything, the plot was a serious let down, the suspense was the worst, ending was horrible, the novel doesnot keep the reader engaged with it, nor does it have any beautiful part in it, the history included in it was almost 7 times actually required to mae the point. If the unwanted historical briefing was avoided I think that the novel would have ended in less than 150 pages. The climax was greatly dragged. so pity of the author. I think that he really has lost his ability in making a masterpiece. Almost 70 percent of the book is history. i am happy i didnt buy this book. Nor will i recommend anyone. If you want real Dan Brown adventure go for angels and demons or davinchi code. I prefer angels and demons.
If you have read 'Da Vinci Code' and/or 'Angels & Demons' in the past and wish to read 'The lost Symbol', then please be aware. It is inferior compared to other two novels, is too predictable, never generates interest and lacks typical Dan Brown style, pace & flair.
The the lost symbol is a totally emgaging and thrilling story... It always keeps you on the edge of te seat ssnd you simply cant keep it away!!!! Also its a good gifting option.. I gifted it to my friend and she loved it too !!!
The book starts of well but the plot vanishes midway. It almost feels like Dan Brown forgot the mystery and brought the book to a shabby end. It took a lot of patience to reach the end. Not recommended at all. Instead, go and read Da Vinci Code and Deception Point over again.
The lost symbol is an awesome thriller in the Robert langdon series .. Made me read day and night .. The best book in the Robert Langdon series.. Waiting eagerly now for the next book in this series ... Dan brown is an excellent author ..
DAN BROWN'S LATEST BOOK DOESN'T HAS THE MAGIC TOUCH OF HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS AND IF HAVE ALREADY READ ANGELS AND DEMONS AND THE DA VINCI CODE THEN U MAY NOT FIND THIS BOOK UP TO THE MARK THE PLOT SOMEHOW SEEMS TOO MUCH STRETCHED THE BOOK AT FEW POINTS EVEN TURNS BORING
The Symbol is a page turner most of the time. However, the suspense which is generally kept till the last moment was not seen in this novel. I am nit sure whether my expectations were that high to which he did not live up or vice versa. All moves were so predictable. At times, certain scenarios were too livid that they were quite a drag. At times, it felt that Dan was out of ideas to drag the story further. Overall, a good read, could have been far better..! K!
I was impressed by the Da Vinci Code, liked Angels and Demons and had high expectations from The Lost Symbol. Sadly all my expectations fell flat on my face as I found the storyline of Lost Symbol to be insipid, predictable and boring. Dan Brown uses the same writing style of his previous works...jet setting the protagonist from one end of the world to another and weaving in endless historical information in between. I hardly ever leave a book midway but in this case I was left with no other option. I gave up reading when Dan Brown started giving a lecture on various architectural relics and their hidden messages while the protagonist is descending into the endless stairs of the basement of the Capitol Hill. If my memory serves me right he started descending the stairs after 60 pages and was still descending even after 130 pages. I have infinite patience but not to the level Mr Brown expects his readers to keep.If you are interested in hidden symbols, their meanings, free masons et al I suggest you read "Holy Blood and Holy Grail". I am not sure how the story ended and frankly I don't give a damn...some of my friends told me the ending was crass...I couldn't agree more with them.
Climax is predictable and seems like Mr Brown seriously miss the collage lecturer job. His sacred teachings about one god is an old idea. Plot was good to some extent however the book was dominated my the authors heavenly ideas and teachings. If anyone reads the book without knowing the author's name he will never be able to predict the correct name.
Readers are given an insight to a wide array of history, rituals and science which is really mesmerizing. A wonderful Masonic History is uncovered in the heart of the Capital Washington D.C. But this typical Dan Brown Book seriously lacks cohesion among the different characters and the roles they play in the story. At one point, you seriously do get lost. There's hell lot of information flowing around seamlessly. Anyways, being a Dan Brown Fan, its a good pick. Don't let the varied reviews stop you from picking this book. :)
Excellent work by Dan Brown...Keeps u indulged until the very end of the book. It was a very mind blowing and awesome experience reading this one....! Very nice..Worth Buying this amazing masterpiece From Dan Brown............!!!
I have read all of db's books. so naturally I was eagerly waiting for his fifth. September 15 put an end to the wait. got the book on the first day and finished it in four days. long, I know, for a db book. but then i had school works. Many complain about it's predictability. yes it is predictable. but it has many interesting things to complement it. Not so bad, the book is, though. But then, it depends
Its good for people who are new to the ocean of literature. but its not a bad dip rather.It reiterates some parts but overall...its just fine.Though Brown continues to amuse us. But this one was below expectations and disappointed a bit. Nevertheless I will encourage the readers to try it out and think of it from their own perspective as opinion differs.
Once when the story starts you will feel something is going but when it comes to the middle you will loose your interest.It will be confusing more with the facts and often repeatedly the Mason's facts will be mentioned. There was nothing in the climax and you will not feel anything rather you will be confused in the end what Mr.Brown was trying to tell. When compared to 'Angels and Demons' and ' The Deception Point' and 'The Da Vinci Code' this novel was an absolute let down from Mr.Brown.
After a good number of captivating series with Prof Langdon, Dan lets readers down with a very lengthy and thin plot, a story woven around America's founder architects. A story not much captivating but a pass off unless you are a die hard fan of Dan Brown. Could have made it more interesting with a better suspense and pace of the story
theek hai! not in the class of da vinci code or angels and demons. codes are childish. ending unsatisfactory. the plot is a drag towards the end and does not fulfill the promise of thrill made in the begining. worst performance by dan brown so far. all the time langdon seems lost at sea to the whole thing rather than being the hero and in control
To give credit where credit is due, Dan Brown did pick two interesting topics for this book but where the book falls apart is the manner in which he has pieced it all together. Over reliance on the Dan Brown formula - super secret sect, one crazy baddie and clues strewn all over historical monumnents have made this a terribly predictable book. The ending was disappointing and it looks like A&D will remain Dan Browns crowning achievement. 2 stars for brining out a bit on the freemasons and Im being generous with the rating here.
It all started with Da Vinci's code! The frame of the plot remained same ever since. The Lost Symbol is no exception. At one point, you feel the author purposefully fooled you just in order to bring in an element of surprise later. However, a regular Brown Reader would've guessed the plot well before it all unveiled. Yet, I would recommend this book as it touched some topics which I often thought about or read about but never found them all at one place. It surely is interesting in its own way. It provokes your thought if you read it more than for its plot. An honest attempt to converge a humongous pile of topics into one single book.
This copy is one of the best by Brown!.. all about freemasonry....Robert Langdon finds out the seceret of his friend solomon about a pyramid which is the key to some kind of treasure!! and the weirdest thing I've discovered is that the villian Mal'akh cut of his testicles!!! just go for it guys...i bet u will find it interesting and the suspense and thrill increases as you turn the pages over and over!!!
As usual of Dan brown, the book talks about another secret society.but on this book the plot so predictable. the story is simple but the way its displayed is too long and exhausting. Too much information was on display so hard to keep in mind.Finally it ends with good message.I ENJOYED READING.A great book every one must reed.
This is my fourth book from Ban Brown. The book is entertaining except for the last few pages.I've never imagined a character like Malakh.The story is gripping, only because of Malakh and I really felt sad at the death of Malakh.
Awesome and thrilling experience taking us through the unknown past. Once you start reading the book u will not be stryaed by any emotion that comes in the. A very quick paced a self revealing work by DAN Brown.
This book was nice. But compared to other Dan Brown books it was not so okay. The plot was not so fast paced or surprising as his other books like Angels and Demons. The villain only kept the book alive. But all in all it was a good read.
Its the worst Dan Brown Book till date. It seemed like the story is jus plugged a lil here n there in a big fat history book. too much info and very less story. Only Caracter to watch out for is the antagonist.
it was mi first order from flipkart.....got it in 5 days but buk was in a very gud concition and recently got iwoz within 2 days . now this is reaallyy fast. it'sa one of d best online shoppnig plces luking forwrd to buy more for sure. ok now for the book..it's an interesting one. booming start,setbacks in between but evntually bores a liitle in d near end.but overall its a 1 time read 4 sure but no match to angels n demons and da vinci code. but ya flipkart rockzzz
nice and interesting one but not as great as angels and demons and da vinci code.
After wishing for more than a year, I finally laid hands on this book. It has the usual Dan Brown feel to it. A secret society of distinguished men, running underground with their own ideals, and protecting an ancient secret that can create havoc if made public. I read the entire thing in 2 days straight, but I guess that was mainly because I had been waiting since so long to read it. An average read, compared to other books by the same author. But a definite value for money. Especially the light paperback version. Thanks to FlipKart for the prompt delivery.
It seems that Dan Brown has let success of 'Da Vinci Code' go to his head. When it comes to plot and bringing it all together this work is quite pathetic. It seems that Brown was rehashing highpoints of 'Da Vinci Code' and served it up as the "plot" of this novel. Apparently, after years of break post his success, he couldn't be bothered to do adequate research or come up with an imaginative story. Don't even get me started on the way it ended (which I had to skip to after having read half the book as I couldn't stand it). The characters are not as well developed, nor empathetic. I am so relieved I did not pre-order this book at stores for the ridiculous price of 700! Don't waste your time. This book is best AVOIDED!
Great book - transforms you into a totally different world! Gripping and interesting with twists and turns. Flipkart, you provide a good service! Please keep it up!
Amazing service by Flipkart. Got the book in one day. Kudos to the service.
good book of facts. though its a fiction ....a convincing one.need to know from where dan brown gets his fictious facts!
I picked this book up on the day it released, hoping it was better than DF, DP and the Da Vinci code(which, let's face it, were predictable. The background information was the only saving grace of those books). My expectations were not exactly fulfilled. Although the background information is very interesting and relevant to the plot, the plot in itself is run-of-the-mill. Mal'akh is supposed to be the antagonist, and instead of instilling fear in me, Brown's depiction of him made me laugh. None of the scenes give you an adrenaline rush. The book doesn't connect to the reader. Pick this book up only if you are interested in symbology. Rating:5.1/10
