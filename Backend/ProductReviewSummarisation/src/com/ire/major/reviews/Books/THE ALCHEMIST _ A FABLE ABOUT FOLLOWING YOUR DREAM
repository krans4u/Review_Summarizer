THE ALCHEMIST _ A FABLE ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR DREAM@@@As always Paulo has presented a master piece again. An excellent book driving and motivating with its writing.
A book that will surely make u imagine and think deep about your dreams. A very motivating book.. It will surely inspire you
I am just taken aback by the story and concept of this book...hats off to Paulo. I heard a lot about the alchemist from many of my friends, but didn't think it would be so overwhelming! thanks to Fipkart.com for giving it to me in such a wholesale price!
If you need a strong motivation ever or need a strong change just read this ,best book I ever read in my life. "Incredible"
First of all the product delivery and the packing was awesome. Apart from that the book is an awesome one to read...
The Alchemist is a good book, but not that great as people says. Paper quality was good. Super service from Flipkart.
There are times when you feel down and low and start thinking what is life really all about. This book is to be read at such times. And , to be with the context of this book, everyone will interpret this book in their own way.
Superb story telling by Paulo Coelho....amazing from start to end...i started and finished it in 3 days...could not help my curiosity...good learning experience :)
Made me search for signs in my life that lead me to my destiny. Very powerful storytelling, all the while making the reader think subconsciously about their life and their destiny. One of those rare books for me which I would like to read when I am low.
it is d jewel of my book case.A good book to read, to b inspired with.thanks flipkart for delivering this book
This book has now stayed for 291 weeks on the new-york times best-seller list, and rightly so. In my opinion it is the best fiction ever written, or at least in this century. It is sure to be a classic. This story makes you feel a sense of calm and peace. It teaches much more than most best-selling self-help books. My favorite novel for sure, I recommend it for every person and I wish every reader not just goes through the story but learns from it as much as there is to learn from it, and there is a lot!!!
I am continuous reader of Mr.Jeyamohan's writings.That's why I felt like it is not what I expected.But In the end I made a decision that I will follow my dreams..thanks to author for that...!
When u really wants something, all universe conspires in helping u to achieve it. â€œIf you start out by promising what you donâ€™t even have yet, youâ€™ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.â€� â€œEvery search begins with beginnerâ€™s luck. And every search ends with the victorâ€™s being severely tested.â€� These are things I have learnt from the beautifully written The Alchemist.
Firstly hats off to flipkart for completing the promised 3 day delivery within two days... Now for the book...There's not much to say regarding this epic novel by one of the greatest... I feel really enriched by the author's thoughts on philosophy after completing this story and also it is not like a story which u can enjoy by reading only once... infact it gives you joy in different ways the every single time u read it..
A wonderful reading. This book tells us why should we dream and why should we be passionate. One of the all time best.
Books has delivered on time flipkart. In my personal opinion its a complete crap book. Waste of money and time.
The Alchemist, is that one good book you must read. The suspense builds as you start reading. I really enjoyed reading this book.
Through out the entire book you feel as id u r living the story. No wonder the book was a masterpiece from Paul
Get the Original one with a good packing. Only in 2 days of ordering. Nice to get it in genuine prize.................. :) :) :) :) : )
The Alchemist . I don't have words for it . Anyone out there can relate to the incidents happening in the book and learn how to deal with lows in our life . It is certainly the best book I've ever read . It has left a life-changing effect on me . Moreover , I could personally connect to Santiago very very much and felt thrilled at times about the coincidences . Those who haven't read this are surely missing out on something exceptionally good . :)
a must have book in ur library...useful for ur lifetime...definitely buy and read...deliver is good...
fiction readers who want to start reading philosophical books ...THE ALCHEMIST could be a good choice but for those only into philosophy /slight spirituality , might not be an extremly good book .... however you can give it a try ...you might like it :) :)
It's a buk which is so suprb and the one which has so many treasures that are to be learnt in our life.I really enjoyed a lot reading this book. I would like to recommend this to everyone.......
It's about following your dream. You travel far and wide to look for treasures, until one day you realize that you had the treasure, right at your doorstep. It's about believing in omens when you venture to start something new. It's about using your knowledge to tackle perilous and precarious situations. At the end, it's all about the magical ride you shall never forget.
Great Delivery.. Great story line - The story is basically to follow your dreams... Follow your dreams and you will reach it some day..!
A book which teaches us to really look at life in a different way. A real page turner which kept me engrossed in it. Simplistic language yet powerful teachings. A must read.
Paulo Coelho is a genius story-teller. He weaves spiritual teachings marvellously through story of a young boy who is in a search of treasure after recommendation of a wise king 'Melchizedek'. Just mentioning the name of this mystical giant is enough to attract a mature person into reading this book. Alchemist reminds us to LIVE OUR LIFE IN BEST and UNIQUE WAY following 'omen' courageously. There is no doubt why this book is in top ten selling books globally like "YOU CAN HEAL YOUR LIFE". I also admire Paulo Coelho for his another work "Brida", "Eleven Minutes" and Autobiographical "Pilgrimage" and "Aleph". His "The Manual of the Warrior of Light" is best book among all.
lightening fast delivery from Flipkart. A good book where the author tries to describe human nature and its assimilation with the surroundings. Not as good as hyped but simply enjoyable.
A very good book to read and to get inspired from. The writer is pretty good with his imaginations. The thoughts and instances given in here are quite fascinating.
the best book i have ever read in my life. it inspire to move ahead in my life and follow my dream. whenever i feel low, i just go through the book and feel motivated.
The delivery was as usual - "Awesome". Got it within two days. This book is kindof an example of good things come in small packages. The read is small but the meaning could take you on a whole different journey. A must read from my side. Thank you for reading and thank you flipkart
Worth the price. Amazing book. This book deals about how to face, follow and attain your dream. It tells about a boy who have his dreams. In the beginning the didn't imagine whether he could achieve his dream but at the end he would achieve his dreams.
I bought this book only recently, I was wondering why I took this many years to buy this which has been appreciated by all. Its truly inspiring, loved it...
Interesting and amusing sometimes, it will take you to its own world or bring itself it into your world....the latter is bcoz..Once in Delhi Railway Station, I was sitting on a platform waiting bench reading my newly purchased book while waiting for my train to arrive, there was a person sitting beside me continuously peeking into my book. Finally, he asked me to show him the book though I was hesitant to do so from my heart, then a smile spread over my face....could he have been the King the boy meets.....Anyway I liked the book.
It was an engrossing read. It's a story about a Spanish boy named Santiago chasing his "personal calling" to uncover a treasure. The book is too philosophical at times but it still infuses a page-turning drive to our brains as we read how the boy achieves his mission.
I believe in its philosophy except for a few places................. The story is short.......... hardly lasts for 3 hrs..........................
A wonderful book that takes you through a magical journey and inspires you. Captivates you till the end and leaves its mark in your life. Hats off Paulo Coelho for your unique ability to create change in people's lives.
My first Paulo Coelho novel. Was pretty impressed by his style of writing. Considering more of his work. Just liked Paulo on facebook. And his each & every update gets lots of likes on facebook. Everytime about 20,000-30,000.
I found the book very disappointing and had to give it away to one of my cousins to save myself the embarrassment of finding myself with the book in possession!!
A Powerful book which highlights the power of Strong Will and Dedication in following one's dreams or ambitions.
it is one of those books, which keeps u glued to it till the last page.....what a master piece by paulo coelho....
This is the best way you can know about life. The optimistic view that this book will give to you is just fantastic. Paulo Coelho wrote a great book, I don't think any words are needed to describe it. What I personally loved about the book is that is gives you courage and inspire you to explore the world and never to give up in life even if, at some point of life, you don't have anything and anyone to yourself and you feel very alone. Just don't give up, there is always a silver lining. This book ask you to break free and just follow your dreams! I think every person should read this book, and really have a copy of it just to yourself!!! It will give lots of energy!!!
an amalgam of inconclusive aesop fables and whimsical plots. i dont get the hype around the author whose books are merely old wine in a new bottle. screw the chronology,introduce a third world set-up, conjure a mental instagram of supposed fairy kingdoms and BAM! you got yourself a glossy 200 paged paulo coulho novel. the whole journey was obvious and rugged like the paper quality.
u should read it twice that my only advice.. a fiction but with a touch of reality and made it in a wonderful way as to make ppl think abt thier own life...
The story of the shepherds journey packs in lots of nuggets of wisdom. The simple prose is easy for readers of all age groups to follow. Paulo Coelho's masterpiece will be read by generations to come.
this site is simply awesome than any other site and has the best price of all..................... the books in it are really worthy and you are having excellent consultancy with your customers thats why FLIPKART stays talll among all
I thk it will be very funny if this book is rated by me and i thk it will a good book to u . hat's off to flipkart for there wonderful delivery :)
it is an awesome book about following your own dreams. it has been an inspiration and you must read this if you have lost hope of reaching your goal
Paulo Coelho's narration was awesome.. a few places its little boring. Its a story about a man following his dreams and his journey to fulfill them. While reading we feel like we are there at the scene to seeing directly the things... Overall its very nice and must read.
A very inspiring story. Actually I bought the book after reading it twice.. so easy to understand.. written in simple language. An amazing book by Paulo Coelho.. Each and every sentence make us thinking..
One of those books tat you will never forget in your lifes , it will remain . I enjoyed reading this book until the very last page .. beautiful ! there is an order to everything in this world .. the fact tat ur reading this review means tat ur well on the path that the universe intended ... cause this book will definitely change ur life !!
It's just that u will love it. reason? soft, tender charming ,nothing new but still some x factor... i don't know, just find it yourself..that would be a journey like the boy in he book, which u will love.
A beautiful tale of dreams... wonderful thoughts.... a perfect story... and all set in a perfect harmony. A wonderful read!
A Motivational book and it is very nicely written. We must always follow our dreams. The book gives an insight about believing in oneself and never lose faith.
The message from the book is very clear. Dare to run after your dreams and they will come true no matter how difficult or impossible they may seem. A good short read for a quick dose of motivation.
To be frank I am still in hangover of this book, given its been 5 days that I've finished it. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't spend at least 30 mins figuring out why I am here and what is it that I really want to devote my entire life to. Whole story short, you must read if you care about yourself and want to live or at least wish to live your life on your own terms.
I read the book in 4 hours time and this is very good. This will teach you that any effort made is not wasted. .
it was a wonderful experience reading such great creations .i couldnt stop reading the book till i finish it.its not just a story but a valuable gift from the author for the present generation as well as to the future generation.i am proud that i have read it.
Author motivates for following your dreams by telling a story of a young Shepherd who follows his dream and uncovers the hidden treasure.Its only a story for those who read flat and a source of inspiration for those who can squeeze the real meaning of the sentence and can relate it to their lives.
One of the best books from Paulo Coelho and worth reading. Books inspires all its readers to follow their dreams and their heart because our heart always knows what is best for us.
This novel is a short and crisp masterpiece written by Paulo Coelho. It's a story about an Andalusian shepherd who travel seeking a treasure, after having a recurring dream about it. The last few pages hold a good climax for this short novel. It's the best novel i have read until now.
I bought The Alchemist when in the time of standing stuck at the crossroads of my life... Alchemist has been a catalyst for it helped me alter my perception towards the equation of life. Paulo Coelho \m/ \m/.
The ending is greatly disappointing and hilarious. Why would any one purchase such a book? Better keep off this crap.
The story is very well narrated by an author. The series of incidents taking place in boy's life are presented amazingly. It's a must read book for those who know their heart beats for some unique reason we call it as a "Dream" to go after but yet they are abstaining themselves to hear its voice! Though it's a fiction story, it relates to person's real life in every way. Author throws light on the power of mind and optimism and that special message is convinced to a reader in a gentle way leaving strong impact! Just go for this book and I am sure it'll inspire you as it did me, to listen to your 'that' precious inner voice no matter what it takes!
It's just a brilliant and marvelous masterpiece by any author. I read and re-read and re-read. Every time I read I learn new things. Its superb. Book lovers must have it in your shelf.
Never read a book more shit than this....even amish's "Oath Of the Vayuputras" Was Better. i Gave the one star only because i came to know from where the "OM SHANTI OM" dialogue was copied.
I heard a lot abt it as one of the best selling novels of all time. So i started from Alchemist.. and it was such a charming story that i completed it with one go (took me approx 6 hrs.) and i thoroughly enjoyed it..
Author is good at writing.... some where at some corner of the page u will definitely feel u real life experience.. Like this book i have it in my book shlef
Very Inspiring, inspires you to chase your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem in today's practical life.
A grt motivational book of following ones dream by Paulo Cohelo.A sentence wh I like d most is "When you really want something from your heart all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"
If you fear following your dreams... then this is the book for you... marvelous story telling... awesome style and easily comprehensible. Must read for every one!
Delivery was great. Can't complain. Got it cheap. Wouldn't want to pay more for it, actually. Though some praised this book a lot, but i am past the age where i'd like stories like these.
It is one of my favorite novels. I started reading this book.It is so exciting that during the reading period I had always the fear that the story would end !!!!!!!!!!! Read this book. You get to know about the Energy of dreaming and Imagination!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you are thinking of starting reading books then start with this guys... My First Book The Alchemist Second is A Thousand Splendid Suns-Khaled Hosseini Third is Kane and Abel-Jeffrey Archer(I am reading it now) pls suggest me some good books in those genres frnds
I loved this book. I am almost going to finish it, hardly 30 pages left. It's one of the best books out there. It makes the reader to think a lot in terms of life!! I just loved it!!! The delivery, as always, was super fast!! Great job, Flipkart!
It's a fable about a person who wants to turn his dream into reality. The book describes everything in story form, which is needed to turn one's goal or dream into reality. The story is written in very simple words and is very interesting. I completed the entire book in just 10 hours and I remained influenced by the story for about a week. And I'll remain influenced by its teachings for my lifetime. The book teaches you few of the following things: a) When you want something, the entire universe conspires to help you achieve it. b) Nothing in the world comes for free. c) God always comes in some form to help those who help themselves. d) Everything happens for our betterment. e) Courage is the only skill that will take you across the difficult times. f) Listen to your heart, it's always right. g) Never become overconfident on coming nearer to the cost after crossing the entire sea. f) God is within us and continuously speaks with us, we just need to question him. h) The treasure is always around us, but life still takes us to long journey just to teach us skills required to become capable of handling the treasure. These are just few, but there are a lot of teachings of the story, that will transform your thought process to make you worth achieving something. Go ahead and read this book and become motivated. Please write a review to help others. Enjoy!! Happy Reading!!! Negative: The only negative thing about the story is that it's very short, it has to be longer enough to get finished at least within a week.
A Great Book. Teaches lot about the life. Takes you through the life of a shepherd who in search of a treasure finds the ultimate treasure of life. After reading this, I bet you would be looking for omens in your life. A MUST READ.
must read for sure. i liked it a lot. it tells us hoe to deal with life, how to choose your path, find love, how to learn, etc.. i loved it and i think everyone loves it. its one of my favorite books...
I personally loved the book. The author takes you on a journey with that shepard boyIt will take you just about a day or two to complete. It's a fable for those who dare to dream, and work towards turning it into reality. :) Post treading this, you may be more aware of the universe's conspiracy through signs and events, to keep you going on the right track!
first of all it is the book you really want to read when you are feeling down. you inspired by this book. In inference it is hell of adventure and great book. you can correlate your self with the shepherd . great book to read and to recommend. great work
It gives you a good insight about life and how you should approach it. However it does involve use of superficial ways of writing but that is only necessary to convey the point(I would rate it 4.5 stars if I could) and Paulo does that remarkably well. Definitely a good read. As for the book itself, it was has about a hundred and fifty pages followed by a short interview and a small scene as an approach to life. Another two pages about Paulo's history. Text is big and clear so is the quality of the paper. Shouldn't take more than 4 hours to complete. An insightful read for a Sunday evening. Flipkart's service: Improving and getting better by the day. Prompt as well as properly packed.
excellent book. it'll definitely upgrade your perspective of life and yourself. good book for mentally energizing yourself. "You are always able to do what you think is right." In your heart you always know whats right, you just have to do it. If you do it your heart will be content. Very good style of narrating what the author wants us to understand.
Its not much interesting.. throughout the book it only revolves around d idea that if u want to achieve something then mysterious invisible forces will help you achieve it.. instead of this read chetan bhagat or JK Rowling
A good start , takes the reader along with the boy(HERO) among ups and downs of life with thought provoking life incidents and ends with a real twist. The authors spritual experience and 'to live the present moment' is well expresssed in this book.
Either I am not able to understand this novel or this is just another boring book... I really donâ€™t understand how so many copies of this novel have been sold!!!!! I request all the readers of this novel please share your true comments about it and let me know if I am a mentally challenged person, who is unable to understand the intensity of the story and its characters!!!
Ordered this book on Flipkart seeing the high ratings and good reviews it had received. This is the first book of Paulo Coelho that I've read. And I must say, it was a good read. The story unfolds in a very interesting manner starting from the meadows of the Spain to the desserts of the Egypt keeping the reader wanting to turn the pages for more. An inspiring book that makes us understand that everything that happens around us is for a reason and its up to us to see the good or bad in it( as in the book, good omen or bad omen). I loved the line-"When you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you achieve it". I believe in it. When we desire something from the bottom of our hearts, when we have an ambition, a dream and if we focus all our energy in realising that dream, its certain it will come true. My rating:4/5 (And Flipkart: Very Good packing On time delivery as always)
It's a really nice book by this Brazilian author,i feel like to go through the deserts again and again. The conversation between Alchemist & Shepherd boy are great & wise.All the elements that will surely make you wonder about the journey of a boy in search for the Treasure.This book is no doubt an International bestseller.It teaches you to how to reach to your dream by surrendering the things that makes you comfortable and facing on to challenges laid on your path...
It's a really nice book by this Brazilian author. It's the first book of him I've read an I really loved this book. The way the story moves and the suspense unfolds and how the shepherd gains the knowledge about the SOUL OF THE GOD. "Superb Work" in shortest possible words.
Those who like fiction and imagination, this is a must read for you! The book is very easy and simple to read. The philosophy and some wisely written things are so amazing. I like a few quotations mentioned in the book. So deep and important to understand life. Especially the end of book is amazing!!!! Thumbs up :)
This Book has all the elements that will surely make you wonder about the journey of a boy in search for the Treasure.This book is no doubt an International bestseller.It teaches you to how to reach to your dream by surrendering the things that makes you comfortable and facing on to challenges laid on your path!!
Great book !! Completed in 4 hours but i feel like to go through the deserts again and again. The conversation between Alchemist & Shepherd boy are great & wise.
Wow.....a magnificient book about dreams,destiny and treasure we seek elsewhere and then ultimately find where we least expect it.It is an inspiration for those seeking their path in life.Amazingly motivational......!!
The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a Beautiful book.You will learn many new things in this book .It is one of the best Self Help books.Hats off to the author of this book Paulo Coelho you will learn hidden truths of the life , it is a journey while reading the book you will definitely enjoy.After reading the book you will become a fan of Paulo Coelho as i became.you should 100% read this book
Whenever I read a book, I experiment the direct impacts on life. The impact of communicating with the unsaid language has helped me achieve confidence and have some faith. I am an atheist, but I feel that the omens are possible. I have seen all of it happening and I finally can understand the soul of the world. Thank you Coelho.
This book is so overrated it is looking overrated in the rearview mirror.Complete philosophical nonsense.Feels like every other self help book crap.Please dont waste your money and time buying this.Would have given this zero rating if there was an option for that.
We travel everywhere to seek our treasures of happiness and peace, but it is always there within us. The language is lucid and simple, even a layman can thoroughly enjoy reading this book without flipping a dictionary.
A beautiful book which will transform the way you perceive things.. It will help you realise that everything boils down to some basic facts,which are lucidly explained in the book..After reading it I have better understanding with life and how things actually work and that everything has a purpose and that all are but one! A masterpiece!
This is hands down the best novel i have ever read. This should be made a movie, even though i have heard that the author is against it.
anather excellrnt tale by coelho.buy it because it will hook you till the end.its never predictable it also have a kind of message that he give to his readers.a mix of fantasy too.just go for it.its a decent read.the character is also very honest innocent
I read this book recently, and it is my first Paulo Coelho book. The story was gripping, and we get to know The Law of Attraction and Alchemy in a storytelling way. It gives us hope and faith, to dream more and more, and achieve them . God's Will is supreme, and this book is a great victory. Must Read.
this is the book , that can really solve all the problem men has in his life, every thing becomes clear when you finish this book, the story is simple, and i have read this book many times and it gives me new meaning every time,
The book talks about dreams.. inspiration .. and many life lessons to take you through to find your own treasure in your life. Not a bulky book ! an Awesome read, and can always leave you with goose bumps and many life changing experiences ! A must Read !
It is a book which will take you to a world of truth through an imaginary world.This book gives,in between the pages,the real meaning of love...and lot many things which will poke through the core of your heart and mind and make you understand about the real part of your life without which the life is nothing about..,that is 'FOLLOWING THE DESTINY' . Flipkart is doing great job.i got the book easily at very favourable price...
"The Alchemist' - a story revolving around a youth named Santiago, a boy living in illusions, seeking materialistic things and quite far away from his destiny is adviced by "The Alchemist" and Omens on a dangerous journey throughtout north africa, a story , weel knit, full of philosophical things and a good climax :D
I must say that I have read this book about 4-5 times and am sure that I will read a no. of times more in my lifetime. Everytime you read it, it gives a new and beautiful meaning to your life. You feel inspired reading this book. Dont just read the reviews, go and buy it at my insistence.
high performance delivered. best book i have ever read, one of the best and sizzling page turners i have ever went through :) one could realize what life is and how to go with it perfect example for how to find a treasure :) hats off paulo coelho :)
Awesome book... Perfectly portrays the mystic talent of Paulo Coelho - The way the complex morals and lessons of life are explained in a simple-to-understand language. The morals of the story are sure to stay with the reader for a long time in his/her life.
fantastic. Truly inspirational and filled with too many things to learn. The suspense towards the end doesnt let you leave your seat before finishing the story.
ALCHEMIST IS ACTUALLY NOT A GREAT STORY WITH TWIST OR TURNS BUT JUST A SIMPLE ACCOUNT OF STRUGGLE YOU FACE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE.IT DEALS WITH THE FEAR THE PEOPLE HAVE IN REALISING THEIR DREAMS.IT'S VERY SPIRITUAL TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE 'SOUL OF THE WORLD' ,'OMENS' ,'LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD' ETC.SO , IF U ARE LOOKING FOR GETTING TRANSPORTED TO THE ANOTHER WORLD THEN THIS IS NOT YOUR PICK.
the book one must read.after reading this one will find new person in them.this book says that when you desires anything.the whole universe conspires to give it to you.the closer one get to reliaseing it`s destiny.the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being
Best book i have ever read. "A must" for all. The way this guy 'Santiago' gains knowledge about the world and communicates with the nature, it is really awsume. The best quote from this book is "What happens once will never happen again. But what happens twice will surely happen a third time."
The title i gave above in the title field doesnt make you feel like boasting, once after you have completed the book. It is truly an enlightening experience reading the book. Bought this book quite a few months ago, but thought of writing a review only after the book shows an inevitable impact on me as claimed by lot of readers. It obviosly did! A few lines from the book like "WHEN A PERSON REALLY DESIRES SOMETHING, ALL THE UNIVERSE CONSPIRES TO HELP THAT PERSON TO REALIZE HIS DREAM" and "THE CLOSER ONE GETS TO REALIZING HIS DESTINY, THE MORE THAT DESTINY BECOMES HIS/HER TRUE REASON FOR BEING" really chaged my perceptions. I really started seeing things in broader and positive way rather than a narrow way which i actually did before reading the book. If you do want to REALIZE your destiny, Its a must read.... thanks to Paulo Coelho for writing such an astonishing book...
It is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. The author really inspires the reader through the story of the main character 'Santiago'. I would recommend this book to those people who are ambitious and willing to pursue it.
Flipkart delivered it on time. It was really a racy ride for me. Since i took a week to complete the book, it left me with a suspense every time i paused on. I liked it very much. I would suggest this book best for people who have thirst for inspiration.
really worth reading many time .. flipkart delivered it to me really quick ... its very inspirational and the book really teaches you how your choices affects your life and how to make those choices , right blend of philosophy, instincts , courage one should have in leading life in a way this book serves you as an eye opener and a guide for people at cross roads... beautiful book :)
Wow... it will change your thoughts about dreaming and following your dreams... Just listen to your heart you will achieve anything you want in your life... The Alchemist is must read book for everyone..
There are no words to convey the beauty of this book. Its beauty is hidden in all of our lives. So if you want to experience that get a copy of The Alchemist soon. Its really a mindblowing work from Paulo Coelho. Enjoy reading........
Alchemist is a nice work by paulo coelho. insightful fable of a boy illustrated simply but beautifully, Santiago's thoughts are somewhat common to at least some of us ! Those will definitely love this book. Not a must read for everyone. But i love this one. 4.5/5
THE ALCHEMIST... â™¥ â™¥ â™¥ a must read book for evry one who want to follow ur heart and achieve ur dreams...awesome expirience reading it...simple story which has a powerful impact on u...!!! I was in a lot of stress, and to be very honest, after reading this book i felt a lot better.This book is toooo good...
i really loved reading this book....it is really encouraging....in the end there was interview of writer...which was really superb......this book encourages all......this book has many important points ...which teaches us many things.....i got delivery in 4 days...thanks flipkart
A very simple tale, outside of the world of glamor and magic.... The tale follows a simple shepherd boy, intending to follow his dreams. A thorough read of this book will get you rethinking about several things in your own life !
When myself and my friend wandering through the bookstall looking some software related books, he forcefully made me to take 'The Alchemist'. Cursing him in mind I have took this book. Once I started reading, I couldn't able to keep this book down. A 'Wonderful' book which motivates you and your dreams. 'At certain point in our lives, we loosecontrol of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by the fate. That's the world's biggest lie' 'Whoever has money is never really alone' It's really a awesome book to cherish the dreams and to 'follow the omens'. Never miss the chance to read this book.
PLOT: A Boy (main protagonist) has a recurring dream,and comes to learn from a woman about some treasure in Egypt which is linked to his dream.He goes in pursuit of the treasure and gets a life time of experience while doing so. Comment:The book sometimes look like self-help books rather than literature.For eg:Something used in Om shanti Om -"if you want something,all the universe conspires to help you achieve it". Recommendation:A nice read.
The story just keeps you glued to the book and it is a must read for one and all. I t gave me a new perspective of life and is definitely life reforming (as said by many).I t has a easy language and transports one into another world.It is very meaningful and opens doors to a new life.
a book which shows that where ever we run for peace we must know that it is just besides us, the key is to understand and make an earnest search within oourselves. GREATEST TRUTHS ARE VERY SIMPLE, so we on numerous occasions simply miss them
This is an essential book for the confused having confusion over their very existence. The book in a very simple manner explains about our duty in life and the importance of grabbing every opportunity that comes our way.
I have so far read numerous books,some by budding writers, some by authors of the decade but whenever someone asks me which is your favorite book, my answer is The Alchemist. I had read it years ago but still remeber it precisely. It has an awesome end which leaves you dumbstruck.Truly one of the finest books i have read so far.
Once, when we were children , we all dreamed of, and imagined our lives getting magically transformed at some stage by unknown powers of the universe. As we grew up, we were discouraged to build castles in the air, and soak ourselves in realism - a catch word for the dreariness, grit, and grime of the real world where one lived to survive. The alchemist takes us back to the magic of our childhood, reminding us that there's always something new waiting to be explored and that each life event was only transient. The journey for each of us begins in our minds.
its one of d master piece novel which one should definitely read once in life.the story telling is power full and gripping as well.Its one of the novel which i read in a go. People who rate it low or something else don't really understand and starts blah blah.. Hats up "Paulo"
The book was fantastic,awesome,amazing,brilliant and ........... There are no words for me to describe about the book. Its just Scintillating .I have to invent a word to explain how good the book is. I'd recommend the readers to buy this.
So simple yet so much insight! I have read most of the books by Paulo Coelho ..ironically the best of the best remained to be read after all these years. well, frankly speaking i don't need to write a review ... it's one of the top 10 best selling books ever... just loved it.. sometimes i wonder why other writers try and pretend to be intellectual when the best of the stories can be narrated in such a simple manner..
this novel is awesome....must read.! this the second novel i've read till now....1st 1 was WAR AND PEACE by Sir Leo Tolstoy, this was a hard one, for a starter but any how completed it,War and peace is also an awesome book for a reader but starters don't buy it..you should start with a book like this 1 "The Alchemist" its features simple english, easy to understand,good literature, great fiction, more...and more ...just order 1 i bet you would love it!....
It is one of the best novel by Paulo Coelho. It touches heart so purely that you can control to yourself stop reading once you started reading. I have started reading in morning and completed by the evening while traveling from Jaipur to Mumbai. One of the lines from novel inspires you more to read as the line says " IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, THE WHOLE WORLD CONSPIRES IN HELPING YOU TO ACHIEVE IT." It has everything in it Mystery, Love, Care, Inspiration, Hard Work, Dedication and more. I really suggest you please go for it
I think this is the book a reader should read in his lifetime. really inpiring and motivating. True locations, and the wonderful atmosphere makes it unique. i will read it again and agiain when i will have time. good value of money spent.
This book is a must buy book. It would help u to decide your destiny and teach u the imp of your life. This international best seller is a life changer. When I received this book (VIA FLIPKART) it was in real good condition packing was done really good. I suggest u this book. HOPE THIS BOOK CHANGE YOUR LIFE 2.
One of the best books I've read. The lovely story of a shephered boy who listens to his heart and follows his dream makes you believe in your own dreams and inspires you to realize your destiny. You may face many obstacles in the path but you should not give up until you reach your objective It teaches you that life is the moment you're living right now, it's a party, there should be no guilt for the past and no worries for the future. "The Alchemist" can change your life, it can act as a teacher for you. It's a must read! "And when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"- Paulo Coelho
I got quite late in reading this one ,but better late then never. Such kind of books are really hard to find. A must read. It is something which fills you with joy and makes u turn every page. The relation with soul is simply awesome.
This is the only book i read of Paul Coelho, but i must say ...its a book every person should read it....an awesome book which inspires you to fulfill your dreams....it ignites your sleeping dreams .....it makes u understand how to chase your dreams and fulfill them.
Total wastage of time and money. Can't figure out what is so good about this book! And where's the inspiration ?? Seeing a dream of hidden treasure in some blah blah blah place and setting out to get it is called 'following your dream' according to the book. And how can a person convert himself into tornado???!!! :D Very boring also. Need some energy drink. Huh!
this is an amazing masterpiece. it gives an insight into life. and the moral which i learned is follow your dream come what may ever .god doesnt give you the things which you 'want' but the things which you 'need'.
Fantastic Books.U do get a feeling of deja vu when u browse through the pages first.but after 10-12 pages u really catch upon with it.THIS BOOK WOULD DEFINITELY CHHANGE UR LIFE.HELP U FIND UR DESTINY OR PERSONAL CALLING. Go For it.BETTER "FOLLOW UR HEART"
Follow your dreams, if u want to achieve them... This is what Coelho tries to convey to the readers. And the message is provided in such a way that it keeps the reader wondering every moment as to what twist is he to get encountered with. It is a feast for those who like literature and the art of story-telling. And believe me, he is a great story-teller. This book has inspired me a lot and has given me a goal to live for. Do read it folks and I am sure you will like it. A thumbs up for the work.
It's an amazing book. Everyone should must read it The story of Santiago is worth reading and everyone who are deaming to achieve something in life must read this. Flipkart is good place to get it. Good price and Quick delivery.
"When you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you achieve it" The whole fable circumnavigate in the vicinity of the above adduce."The Alchemist" is an audacious and cogitative story (written as fable) of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy,who like all of us, is in search for his destiny. Unaware of all the contingencies he takes the risk and travel in search of a treasure from his home in Spain to the alien markets of Tangiers and then into the Egyptian desert, where a fortunate encounter with the alchemist awaits him. Paulo Coelho has embellished the story with many provoking thoughts through minuscule incidents which Santiago encounters in his struggle. The book also lay emphasis on many variables such as positive invisible forces, wisdom of listening to our heart, dreams as languages of God, nocturnal cold, elixir of life, central role of every individual in history of earth, beauty as the greatest seducer of men etc. Published in 67 different languages, highly extolled by the critics, the book was originally written in Portuguese in the year 1988 and has now sold 65 million copies!!! The alchemist has made it to the bestsellers list in 74 countries and thereby has attained the status of modern classic. What else you want? A book with such a brilliant record. I strongly recommend this book specially for people seeking their path in life. I completed the book in 3 days time, a cinch book, about 160 pages, with very less difficult words. The most notable feature of the book despite of OK type vocabulary was that it is highly inspirational and increases the motivation level from nadir to zenith, of the reader. Some sentences in the book will compel you to think how to go beyond the rock walls of perceptions, prejudice and conditioning to achieve splendid success and your true heart's desire.
Its a fine read. The story is nothing exceptional. We find the rags-to-riches story almost everywhere and in tons of other books. Was not very convinced after reading it but since I have heard so many reviews of this book i had to go for it. In short, doesn't deserve the hype it has generated.
Great book i have ever read. Thanks to Paulo Coelho and flip-kart. It deals with one's dreams which determines their destiny. Every person should read this, especially who want to fulfill their dreams. I got carried away(went to imaginations) with it when i was reading the book.
A very good book with great insight on what life is all about and how to make the most of it. This is definetly a book you should read before you die. The story telling is spellbinding and leaves one with an insight into the life of generations of human race, which were in search for something more.
Am a die hard MARIO PUZO fan..and never changed it... Read this book in 4 sittings... This is the first book of paulo coelho to be read by me. I feel this book as one of the best motivating books for all kind of people.. No person in this world will never hate this book.As we star readin,we'll surely 'get inside' the story.One of the best books to dig a seed of positive thinking in our mind..REALY LOVED THE BOOK...
This is a magic book. I think that it is the most suitable definition for the book. Just like alchemistry is mentioned in the book and that it can change lead into gold, the book can change the lives of many people. Though written around 25 years ago, the book still retains its alchemical magic. The book concentrates more on philosophy than story. I has the record of being the most transalated book in the world. It has sold 65 million copies and thus, it holds a prominent position in the list of the best-selling books in the world. Originally written in Portugese, the book was written in two weeks. This is a must read for everyone.
This is a MUST READâ€¦ There are no words to describe this splendid work by Paulo Coelho. Paulo Coelho is known for his â€œInspiration and motivationalâ€� book, and this is one of his best work. This is a simple book put together so beautifully that you will get engrossed by its wonderful scenery, and get inspired by â€œthe Shepardâ€� who chases his dream through all the obstacles put before him. This book will revive your long lost dream, and gives you hope that it is still not too late to achieve them. It Inspires you; and Motivates you to DREAM and never stop chasing it. To know what I speak of or to understand what I say, you have to read this BOOK. Go ahead and buy this book, I assure you that you will never regret it. â€œBut at one condition though, that you shouldnâ€™t dead within for you wonâ€™t be able to see what lies in front of you.â€�
Hi all, I have almost completed half of the book.. and I am thinking that my decision to buy this book is absolutely right.. I am liking it and as the pages are moving the interest in the book is growing..
O marvelous simply great was the experience !! the book reveals about the dream of a boy..but the moral is very great ....To fulfill the dream we must believe the god he is always here always here and here and when the man stops all his efforts to capture the dream and fails the factory of God starts and he not only make the person happy but also give a knowledge that guides him for the whole life. Very well written by Sir....
Definitely its a good inspirational story for our life. But paper quality is poor for the book i got. Except that everything is good. But if you only want to read the story and dont want the paper to be of superior quality, then its worth to buy.
Awesome book by Paulo Coelho, amazing story, highly interesting, high on spirituality aspect, interesting twists and turns in the story makes it very much interesting. It teaches you to just follow your dreams....
As i had herd of it from many people of this master novel, i thought of it to read and experienced it myself..which i really did in a very good way..its a very gripping story of dreams and hope..as i am a slow reader but i completed this novel in 2 days...as it got quite engaging plot..in some parts you wont get whats going on & where it will lead the story..but as the story concludes you will really be blown by its end..the story teaches you to follow your heart and flow with it, to reach the destination you dreamed off.
This extraordinary book will give you the hope, the strength and the courage to keep moving in life, without worrying about the negativity around you and the world. 'The Alchemist' is something you can consider as one of the most valuable possessions of your life; because it will change your life for good and for the better. Read this when you tend to forget that you are an amazing person and you have everything you need to succeed in life within yourself; this book will surely help you to remind you of the same. Thanks Paulo for writing this amazing book to help millions around the world!
i found this bool interesting as i have never tried anything other than mere friction,fantasy and romantic novels. for those who want a change from their usual pattern this one would be a great start, even though i have this book with me for quite a long time i haven't completed it, this book i should say lack urge required to complete..... this fable cover's almost every aspect of life...love...journey to your dreams... companionship...this story definitely show you a new sight...a different view about life.. mind blowing quote from this amazing work "when you want something,all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it....." "the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn"... happy reading....
The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a book which tells how a boy follows his heart to reach his destiny and the difficulties he faces while reaching his destiny. So i feel this book is a great motivator for all those who want fulfill their destinies or dreams.
this book is way too brilliant to be described by a few reviews, i believe. just read it if you like reading at all. but if you dont like philosophical stories then avoid.. and as always service was amazing by flipkart yet one more time!
I have read this almost 5 years back and guess i often read it today from head to toeall over again when i feel low in life. This book has a saying that if u really try to get sumthing in ur lyf then the entire universe comes together to take u there. Only u nid to believe in ur believe. It talks about love, faith,ambition,.. And above all destiny.
This book will be my all time favorite! I don't know how some people rated it 1 star .. u don't rate a masterpiece like this. Its not in the same league as the 5-star books - its definitely better than them! Like DaVinci's Mona Lisa, Coelho's The Alchemist is one of the best known work of art n literature ! An exceptionally good philosophical book - there will never be another book like this. I've read n re-read this book and it still doesn't get old for me.If you don't have it yet, I'd say this one must be on your priority books-to-buy list! Happy Reading!!
This books takes you through a mysterious journey of understanding the hidden treasure in every body's life. The experience can only be felt.This is one of the finest modern philosophical books in the rank of Jonathan Livinston Seagull by Richard Bach.The narration of the story is lucid and simple in language but a profound truth underlying every sentence. Every one who wants to understand the meaning of life must possess this book.
This is probably one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It is very inspiring and lucid and you really get a feel of whats going on. Surely a must read for all those who strive to make their dreams come true! Also, the discount on the book was amazing! Gifted it to a friend, who loved it! :)
First point is the prompt delivery by flipkart, am very much impressed and coming to the book, to be frank, it glued me, though I am not a serious reader!! Looking forward to read more interesting books from the author. Thanks Paulo and flipkart for a great book!!
nothing more than must read. the book tells to follow our dream that we live with and grow lounging for them. it tells us the answer to why one should do and what does it mean to our life.i read the entire book in a night without a blink. so i think it has something that keeps readers interwoven to the story.
A very good read. must have in your book collections. the author keeps explaining about the fiction in a strong way! keep chasing your dreams. one quote i remember from the book which i wanna mention it here : "see the marvels of the world with out spoiling the oil in spoon" .
Paulo Coelho has set benchmarks in making philosophy an easy experience through the means of fictional story telling..The tale of Santiago concisely explains the questions and expounds on our bafflements that rattle our mind and soul in a way or the other. Overall a rejuvenating experience.
I read this novel two years back but now i have got the chance to share my experience. This is one of the beautiful novel that i have come across. It is an inspiration for those who believe in their dreams.
fiction and philosophy, great inspiration in simple words. what a combination it is. I think its a must read book for a reader.. I will read his other books too, for sure. it brings outs the every positive thing you have and to think out on every possible way. it surely helps you to think on the other side of a obstacle, the positive one..
This sure is one of the most influential books of all time. A masterpeice..! It did help me in changing my way of thinking. I actually believe stongly in the law of attraction and i found this book, though not mentioned directly, was supporting the law of attraction. The writing is very mature and do not hesitate to buy this book. And i'm a regular customer of flipkart and their service had been extraordinary..! :) thank you flipkart.
This book talks about dreams, aspirations, sacrifices, destiny & the beauty of the unknown in a magical way, Paulo Cohelo is the creator of a world which is both magical & realistic,he builds a bridge between the real world and the paradoxical dreams that sometimes we aspire. This book will be a masterpiece for years and years to come.
Nice Reading Experience Could complete it in one day Short and sweet. As per other reviews , I have not found any profound Enlightment or something , It was just a good feel and flow that i felt good about this book.
The alchemist is one the most beautiful book I've read. It can influence our mind also. And the author could make us think in his own way. That makes this book a best one. The international best seller - it is such a good book. Thank for flipkart. And Paulo Coelho....
I purchased the alchemist with certainly no prejudices in mind, other than the fact that it is targeted at readers constantly interested in â€œself-improvementâ€�. When I was going through the Alchemist at one of the book stores it said that The alchemist opened the eyes of the editors and that reading the alchemist was like waking up to a morning lit by the sun. Crass-I tell you. It is no such thing. But certainly the Alchemist is a book written many years back in the 1988 in a foreign language was translated into a English. It initially sold only a few copies and it was only after some marketing exercises that the book actually did sell. The alchemist is a set in a fairy tale world and that is why I must say a few people will dislike it. As I read though; it really did reflect pages from my own life. I should say that it is one of the best books that Iâ€™ve read in the self-help category. Itâ€™s complete and covers every aspect of life. Paulo Coelhoâ€™s has since then written many books ranging on subjects from life, sex to suicide. He makes excerpts from his books available on his website and says that the internet Generation must read his books. Everyone from Madonna to Bill Clinton has read The Alchemist. Paulo Coelho writes a Blog and also maintains a twitter account too interact with his readers and audiences. But in a world of increasing use of technology people are losing touch with themselves hence self-help books are bound to sell more than fiction novels. Some â€œinspiringâ€� quotes from the alchemist include â€œAnd, when you want something, the entire universe conspires in helping you to achieve itâ€� which is astonishing because in spite of following our dreams we face unmanageable obstacles. There are many such quotes by self help writers which are motivational but are not entirely true. Finally I do suggest Jiddu Krishnamurti and Osho who are Indians but may be not well known in the global sphere to be read by everyone. Theirs is a school of thought and no Fairy tale. We all turn to self help books at some point of our life but the school of thought that we adopt is essential. Paulo Coelho is a school of thought not as convincing and thoughtful as Jiddu Krishnamurti or Osho which are my recommendations.
Its a good book...no doubt in that... Some good advices... but not weaved in a proper story line... Its just like some one is advising you... May be its just me...but seeing the number of copies sold...I thot it must be some great book...but I got bored while reading it...Not to mention disappointed when the title-The Alchemist- is not that important character in the story..
Well i had expected so much from this book as i have heard of it but it's a satisfied experience for me , in this book you will find a story which holds you back from starting to the end of the book.A good story as well as motivational one also for all those who want to be motivated and try to do something by coming out of their comfort zone. Nothing is so easy to get but it's not hard also. So finally i have to say a good book which worth your money.
Paulo Coelho has always been associated with serious writing..mindful writing..writing that makes one introspective. Alchemist is to top it all. Not for base level readers, this book is for those who have a strong hold on English. After several twists and turns does one get to understand why what happened.. yet at the end, one understands what makes a life tick.. its sheer hard work, undivided dedication for the goal. read it to reflect on your own life..are you really doing what you should be doing.
The first book which i had in my hands and read half the story and was enchanted the way the writer has narrated the story.. it was than I realized that I love reading books and turned my hobby into Reading. That's the power that lies in this book, you just cant have enough of Paul Coelho's writing.. Worth buying and spending time on it. one would surely end up finding himself after reading the book..:)
Alchemist was supposed to be this life changing book, but I failed to find any meaning or sense in it. The story does not make a strong impact on you. I could not relate to any of the characters. The book is a breeze to read, but that does not make it a great book as it us put out to be.
A philosophical book with a story line. The realization of the kid that what he desired was not what he really wanted. Another book to convey that if you really want something all the things that happen around u act as omens and work towards your dream. One optimistic way of making u realize that your dreams are not that far away.. :)
Just like everyone else, this was my first book. And I couldn't have chosen a better one. The book has been written with a very optimistic feel that will definitely make you feel better. The author explains his philosophy with a very interesting story that take twists and turns throughout, keeping the readers bound to it. One of best 'feel good' books ever written.
After reading this book your perception about life changes............. There's just one word that describes this book: . . AWESOME About the writer: What can I say about a man who give his literature free of cost on his website. He is a true writer. Keep it up Mr. Coelho.
Hi every1 this is ma first english book i ever read before,and am happy tat i choosed the best one . i cam to knw abt tis book by one of ma friend ten i bought it aft starting to read i impressed by the story it wil take u to his own world u can feel it while studyin
The book is a Paulo Coelho's masterpiece, stressing the need for believing in miracles. The book isn't merely a story, but it is the art of living, if not the rule of the universe.. read the book (if u still haven't) and enjoy the miracles of life..
this book is really such an amazing pack of things related to life,love,fate and self determinant...i have read this book thrice just to gain inspiration from it,i think its best of the books i have read in mah life....it leads to certain level where you gain a 200% confidence in you..!!!
This is an amazing book. Not for any particular age group. Any one who believe and practice spirituality and Who wants to understand their own heart and follow their dreams must like this book without a doubt.
I am new to reading. Most of my knowledge in sprituality is through participation in forums/communities. So technically this becomes my first completed book. I had plently of pleasent moments in my mind reading this book and this book gives an optimistic feeling for a reader like me. I feel this book gave the right start to my new venture and I am thankful to the author. About flipkart: One of the best in service... Quick and professional :)
I brought this book 2 days ago from flipkart.com , though i was searching it everywhere, but worthpaid i get what i want from this book, amazingly narrated , greatest dedication and superb to read.. Hats off!!!
A thought provoking story about the journey a young shepard takes to meet his destiny. Put yourself in his place and it's a wonderful read. I still wonder why not much has been written about the Alchemist which the english man was searching.
A very good book in terms of Philosophy. i would say one must read this to enhance their confident levels. Such an awesome experience I had with this book. I remembered that I started reading this book but never realized that I have read for whole night to finish the book. I realized only when Sun got out, that it was morning. The theme was very good and I would say One have to read this. Kudos to flipkart team, they delivered the book on the very next day. I loved their service...
This is a magical book about destiny... but one thing i cant understand is how we find our destiny. may be you can find your destiny by this.. really inspirable, Easy going, good book.. Must read one..
I'd read this book long time back but misplaced it. Ordered it again and thanks to Flipkart i got it within 2 days. This book is a must have if you like philosophical books. (No spoilers - It's about a boy following his dreams ). Good read.
it ws a wndrfl book....... bst one amongst Paolo Coelho's collection. May have a great impact on people. mst read it......! may help u in realizing the omens that u find , cuz most of the time u ignore them and end up making a mistake. the book has incidents that'll surely teach u leasons.......
I consider The Alchemist as a magical work of fiction. This is one of the best fiction books ever written. Once you start reading the story of Santiago the shepherd, you feel that the words of the book are mellowing in your mind like snow is melting and converting itself into dew. The odyssey of Santiago starts and you feel like becoming an eye-witness of all the happenings. The story ends with a revelation about life. Excellent piece of work. Highly recommended for people who like to read great works!
To start with I have to say that though i am an avid reader but i hadn't read any serious novels before this one. Only Chetan Bhagat was the one i managed to complete. After reading this and if you are able to implement its teachings, your life will change completely. This book is not easy to start reading. I myself read the first few pages a few times and never went on. Once you read 30 to 50 pages, you will start appreciating the book. For those saying the story was not worth it have failed to completely understand the book. This is not meant to be a one night read. Its something you need to read slowly, cherishing and appreciating the writing. I took a month reading it and i read only one or two pages at a time, afraid it would end. However, i warn you this book is no magic. Expect it to be good and you will love it. If you begin expecting it to be out of this world, you won't be able to cherish it. In conclusion : Read this! There is a reason why it has sold numerous copies worldwide. No other book can ever come close to this for me.
This book is a must read for every human being on this planet. Page by page, it keeps opening the closed closets of our brain and make us view this whole world with a different view. A very good story combined with a mesmerising philosophy about how to fulfill your dream, this book simply awakens our senses.
This is one of the easiest to digest philosophical writings I have read in recent times. What an inspiring fable! The fable-like approach makes it easy to comprehend. It should be made a must-read for young school children. Will help many in achieving their dreams.
This book is the best I have read till now.I have read twice & am sure that I will read again in coming times. On a broader perspective it teaches you how one should live his life, in general that we should believe in ourselves be it our dreams or what we want to desire to achieve and should always try to give our best and till the end before you decide to quit because you never know that just one step, one more try can make you achieve what you been trying for so long. This book completely justifies the saying that "Pen is mightier than sword."
Its a book that will make you muse over the essence of your existence and make you introspect. it not just inspires you from within but fills you with a kind of confidence and urge to move on its A MUST READ for all those people who believe in their aspirations and in the beauty of your dreams
THIS BOOK HOLDS TOO GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DREAM AND ARE THEISTIC AS WELL. BUT IT WILL BE SURELY A BOREDOM AND LITTLE IRRITATING FOR THE OTHERS. BUT THIS BOOK IS A GOOD PAGE TURNER AND HAS A BETTER STORY LINE. YOU WILL LOSE YOURSELF IN SOME OF THE GOOD PAGES. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MUSLIM FANATICS ARE GOING TO ADORE IT TO THE CORE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THOSE WHO ARE NIHILISTIC EVEN WILL LIKE IT. BUT IT WILL BE A POSITIVE FORCE FOR DREAM IF YOU HAVE ONE..
some fundamental truths are written in very simple manner, such that you will feel like you know it but discovered today. The book should read at the earlier stage of life so that someone can come into knowledge of judgement of natural behavior, its importance in our life and relevant circumstances.
As you might have already read, most of the reviews are positive, they all are true. The Alchemist is not only philosophy, its good philosophy. Also, its story is very interesting. The blend of the two is shockingly beautiful and will keep you on the hold until you read the final page. I would say that every person should read this book once, so as to get a clear meaning of life. I would give the book a 4.5/5 as the book scores on everything except its length. After finishing it, you will for sure regret its short length.
This book was okay. I think the message of this book is follow your dreams. I liked it; but I am not sure that I would recommend it. I enjoyed the imagery of The Alchemist. The story moved a bit slowly. It wasn't a page turner, but it wasn't a tough read either. The Alchemist is a nice fable;but, that's it.
Awesome piece of writing man, Paulo Coelho's done a very great job, i just loved THe Alchemist.. And i am now gonna read all of his writings from now on. The story containing the soul and power which guides us all our life is just marvelous,
Once you start reading this, you can't stop. It is filled with Magic and inspiration. Personalty for me it helps me to find my true self. Highly recommended. As far as the physical aspects goes, I am highly satisfied. The paperback cover is well built and page quality is also perfect. One thing to mention that the book's cover image is different then the one you are seeing right now. You will get an horse riders cover image when you get the book. But i am sure that wouldn't make much difference.
got the book in excellent condition with a bookmark in less than 4 days!!!!!!!! I have not started reading this book but I have heard that the book is pretty awesome and it motivates u greatly........buy this book if u want to know your true purpose in life.......and the packing quality was amazing.....thanks flipkart!!!!
It is not just a book made up of paper,it a soulful collection of characters ,words and lines.It is blissful book which makes your life more lively.Very well written and must read for all book lovers.Its a book recommended by my Guruji and is worth recommending to others.
It is one of the most inspirational book you could read. Story flows smoothly and always leaves u with surprise and make u egar to read more and more. Flipkart services are execellent, book was delivered within committed time.
My favorite book. I am yet to read a book as powerful as this one. A human tale that is inspiring, positive and supernaturally strong motivator. A Shepherd travels to a destination of his dreams while unravelling the super strength of mind. A must have in the collection.
I think Paulo Coelho wrote the whole novel based on, 'If you want something, the whole world conspires in your favor',I think it's pretty true too. A Shepard from Andalusian region, goes to pyramid, to make his dream turn into a reality. During his journey, he meets people, learns languages, business and many more stuff.
This is a book which you can never forget and you will recommend to many ppl.The lesson which i got from this book is that in difficult times the SUPREME POWER will show u the right path.. I was surprised to see the reviews of some ppl describing it as a Bad book..
After hearing so much about this book from friends,reading the reviews, after seeing this book sweep the "favorite book" of amateur readers i gave it a try. To my horror it is one of the most disappointing book i've ever read. The story reminds me of my 6th class pointless moral science lesson. Spend ypur hard earned money on something else
This is an awesome book...one of the books by Paulo Coehlo which I have reread multiple times. It sort of helps you restore faith n hope when things dont seem to fall in place :) ! I can also relate the message in this book to the one in "The Secret". Both books talk about following your dream, asking the universe for what you really want and having the elements of the universe conspire to make things work for you !
I recieved the book intact within three days, a genuine new book packed perfectly to avoid damage.
The book itself is an awesome read. However ppl at Flipkart are carzy.. shipped in 2 days. AWESOME>>
As we all know about the book....it is exceptional. I have read it many times. So talking about Flipkart... Service : 5/5 Product : 5/5 Quality : 5/5 I gifted this book to one my friend in Hyderabad...she got it within 3 days..beautifully gift wrapped with the message i left...as expected she was surprised and excited too. What more one can ask for ??? Thanks a lot Flipkart and Team!!
Total waste of money and time:( It is vague, sometimes appears too spiritual. Difficult to comprehend. May be a great literary work but not for me!
A bestseller for 260 weeks... Is there something else I need to say..??
Must read .......... Unless you are missing lot of........
frnds ...it is a classic..ITS A BEAUTIFUL BOOK ABOUT MAGIC,DREAMS AND TREASURE.. EVERY FEW DECADE A BOOK IS PUBLISHED THAT CHANGES THE LIVES OF ITS READER FOR EVER.THE ALCHEMIST IS SUCH A BOOK..
Alchemist is the most over rated book I have ever read. Lured into it by its popularity which is just a thick mirror which covers basically very little material inside with no concrete story line and very weird philosophy this book fails to knock any of my senses. Better spend your hard earned money on some other author than paulo coehlo. Best wishes if you still read this!
THE ALCHEMIST is a beautiful book about magic, dreams and the treasures we seek elsewhere and then wnd on our doorstep...
Paulo Coelho's "The Alchemist" is a priceless treasure one can hold. Translated in a simple English, it gives you different meaning each time you read. If you have any plan to buy it and you peruse through the reviews whether it will be useful, I say, you must get it and I'm sure you'll become a fan of Paulo...
in the starting .. the story turns out to be a very intresting .. page turner .even the ending ... of the novel where he undergoes adventure in EGYPT is also pretty awesome but .. the hecking word SOUL OF THE WORLD.. just pissed me off anyway its cheap ..small.. one must try it atleast!
i ordered this book and i got the same in a time span of less than a day! amazing packing and the coolest delivery ever! keep up the job! and as for the book..well..i haven't finished it yet..but it surly is mesmerizing.
