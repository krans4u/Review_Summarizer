Godel, Escher, Bach _ An Eternal Golden Braid@@@Due to the innovative use of dialogues preceding each chapter, the material becomes accessible. The material it deals with is still not easy to get a grasp on , but with effort it is possible. Flipkart's service was satisfactory as usual.
A extremely well written book, which provides deep insights into how our current system of scientific thought and reasoning is organized.
The ideas discussed are inspiring. This book can change your perspective of the world. Complex concepts of Theoretical Computer Science have been introduced with exemplary grace and subtlety with the use of analogies to music and art.The writing structure is wonderful. Reading this will take more than an average book as there are a number of puzzles to solve and questions to ponder. This isn't for light reading, unless you have a good CS background, in which case you'll have some idea about the concepts discussed and you'll enjoy it even more.
This book is a very heavy read, and is also very bulky, it's one of those book which you don't go through for the sake of reading it, Highly recommended.
The book delves deep into Music, Art, Maths, Literature, Programming, Artificial Intelligence , Zen and Philosophy . What results is a mind blowing realization of the intelligent structure in everything. The book will change your perception. A must read.
This book is worth all the time one can spend on it.Though I have read only the first half till now,I am supremely impressed by the arguments and the intriguing nature of the work.It requires elementary knowledge of discrete mathematics and its NOT for casual reading.Logicians,philosophers,programmers will enjoy it.As you read you will walk through the gardens of metaphysics,
It is an excellent book. It is a must read for every Computer Science student. Any person who is interested in Maths, Arts or Music will surely appreciate the book. The book is not for casual reading. You need to get thoroughly immersed in the book to fully understand everything. The delivery and packaging done by Flipkart was excellent, as always.
This is a trip. It took me eight months to finish the book. And all through that time, as Dylan said, my toes were too "numb to step". I kind of glided my way around. (I think). At some point in our childhood we first ask the question about our origins and we are told about the stork. When what we really wanted to know was about the whole sheebang! This is a massive effort to approximate an answer. The book's made up of life altering stuff. Beware!
