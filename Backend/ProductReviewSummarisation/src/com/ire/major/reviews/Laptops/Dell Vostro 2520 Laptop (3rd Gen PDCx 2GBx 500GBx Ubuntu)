Dell Vostro 2520 Laptop (3rd Gen PDCx 2GBx 500GBx Ubuntu)@@@Hi, i have got my laptop yesterday, vostro 2520, really awesome...but for windows 7, WiFi and Bluetooth drivers are not getting installed which i have downloaded from dell portal. Please help me if you have any idea...
This machine is just superb for daily usage and activities. Its is just a Everyday-Use laptop so one should not buy this with an ambition to play games on it. It has got a 2.4 GHz processor accompanied with 2 GB RAM which provides enough juice to make up for the day's work. One more plus point is its expandable RAM capacity. Upto 8 GB of RAM can be installed in here. The display is great with Anti-Glare coating. The inbuilt Web-Camera is excellent. It has got one of the best speakers found in laptops. It has a good chiclet keyboard (without the numpads present on normal keyboard layout). The keys on the keyboard are well-spaced. It has a nice Matte finish on the lid whereas a metallic finish in the inside. The touchpad response is great. Both Windows 7 and Windows 8 64-bit works like a charm. It has a premium feel with it even in this price range. It gave 4 hours battery backup which is again not bad. The device does not heat up quickly so its comfortable for use. A letdown is that if we install windows separately, we have to download and install drivers from the company website separate which is a tedious process. The inbuilt microphone makes a *hush* sound behind the voice, specially if ceiling fan is turned on. Another fault is that warranty on this product starts on the day DELL HAS SHIPPED THE ITEM TO FLIPKART and not when flipkart has shipped it to me. Overall its a best buy if you are looking for a laptop in this price segment.
As usual the item was delivered within the time frame, the package was excellent. The product is worth purchasing considering its low cost, i think no equivalent product is available for the price with these features. Dell has also added a cream of free bag and McAfee antivirus software (15 months), which is also a good deal. Only draw back was that, hardware drivers do not come with the laptop, which is definitely an issue. If you are to load a new OS other than UBUNTU, then it becomes a big issue. Though all computer manufacturers supply driver CD with the PC/Laptop, its surprising that Dell is not providing, its not clear whether Dell is not providing or flipkart is not providing. Though I wrote to the customer care of flipkart, they informed that the driver CD's are not part of the laptop, which is surprising and astonishing. They informed providing driver CD violates media regulation, i can't understand what media regulation they are talking about. All manufacturers ship driver CD along with the Laptop. Inspite of my repeated mails, they did't reply. Other than this driver CD issue, its great product to buy, its worth purchasing.
very nice features in budget best for starters I gifted it to kids of my maternal uncle who are in school and are learning computers thanks flipkart for quick service
Good Business Laptop for the price we pay, researched many LapTops but found this best. We can use it comfortably for 2 years before we switch on to better technology.
it is very good laptop in the given price, has good video quality, good battery, all over better for daily uses
Such a bad service by flipkart i have never seen till now and now i have decided that not to buy any item from flipkart nor recomend any one from them I have paid extra money for next day delievery and next day i receive a message from Flipkart saying that delivery has been delayed for one more day I had ordered netgear router in normal delievery which has come along with this My concern here is some one from Flipkart should have called me and informed me about the delay and return my extra amount which has been paid by me instead they have given me the coupon which i have to utilised in buying the product next time Why shall i buy the product from flipkart when a customer have other options now a day? When i tried contacting on Flipkart customer care and wanted to speak to the senior customer service officer the person who was talking to me has said he doesnt have authority to transfer the call neither he has authority to give the solution for my problem He kept on repeating saying that this is the company policy I would like to ask the flipkart authority that your company policy is more than your customer satisfaction ?if this this the case then i am sorry this is pathetic and ridiculous
I ordered a Dell Vostro 2520 laptop and received it next day...it was well packed and got it scratch less.... It's been a month now and it's working without any problems. Thanks Flipkart :)
this laptop is good and does what I want. I wanted to buy it for my wife... she uses it for work, email, movies and general purposes.. 10/10 .... the only thing I hoped was to get it 10 K cheaper.. i installed win8.1 and it works like charm..
its very good at my budget, it is 20 % cheaper then the market price, now shopkeepers will have to close their business, FLIPKART IS SELLING AT A THROW AWAY PRICE
Got this computer for beginners (for my cousin) at the Best price from Flipkart.... @ Flipkart - The EMI cashback offer is good. Keep giving us great offers like this. Planning to buy another one for my other cousin.
I bought this laptop via Flipkart 2 weeks ago. Price - Flipkart's prices are competitive compared with the other sites (I noticed a difference of +/- 150/- on other sites. Delivery - Superfast, maybe because i live in bangalore. But hands down, they are the best! Packaging - excellent again. Now coming to the laptop. Overall build - good for home use Screen Clarity - Not the best, but not worst either. I guess its average. Keyboard - No numeric keys even though this is a big laptop, but the keyboard layout is good so you don't feel the need to have a numeric keypad. Touchpad - This is where the laptop falls short of expectations. The touchpad is buggy and you cannot smootly operate it. The surface is not smooth enough and the mouse pointer jumps when i operate it. I don't expect it to be slick like a macbook but then you expect a decent response. You can try and make the trackpad better using a updated device driver. Processing power - Again, this is a entry level laptop and delivers to the expectations of an entry level one. Who is this laptop for? - Students, Housewifes, Elderly, Non-IT savy people. Operating System: Comes with Ubuntu by default. If the users are looking only to browse, i would suggest handing over the laptop to them as-is. Much better for non-tech guys as there are less chances of them ending up with a virus on Ubuntu rather than windows ;) You can upgrade the RAM at a later point if required. But the built in 2 Gb is good enough for normal tasks, so not mandatory. You don't get a driver CD along with the laptop, so if you are planning to install Windows on this machine, do ensure you have internet access so that you can download the required device drivers from the dell website. Overall, you get a Value For Money laptop. Don't use it like a gamers laptop and it may give you a few years before giving you heating / battery issues.
This s my first review on flipkart because i must write it for this superb product. Thank you flipkart for shipping in 2 days and its packing.. Let me give my Positives and Negatives. Positives : 1) Price 22700 Rs (for using debit card they give you 650 back ). 2) 2GB/500GB configuration with 2.4 GHz Processor speed 3)1.3 M.P camera 4) A cute bag 5) I can bet you can't get a lap of above conf with this price , cause i spent over 2 weeks for this. Negative : 1) Only O.S that u can install pirated software. P.S : So don't wait , just go for it before the stock closed :) :) Go Go Go :) :) :)
got the product at 1day love ur delivery process. best price please expend ur delivery point so we can get product at home i have to order this product at my friend house.
Flipkart Delivery: Excellent and very timely. They have even included a free Targus bag which was a pleasant surprise. Thank you very much. About the Laptop: Dell was always a preferred brand for me, as I am an IT Specialist and have been in the world of Technology for quite some time. Their Laptops are built quite well and are solid too. Vostro 2520 is no exception to this statement. In the looks, it is good, and has very basic set of function keys if you compare with some high-end laptops. However for the price for which you get this laptop, it is amazing. I wouldnt like to talk about the performance as it is standard built and it works the same way in any other brands. I have uninstalled Ubuntu and have installed Win 7 as I prefer it more. Overall this is a great laptop, if you are looking for a reasonably priced one from a good brand. I would strongly recommend this for such audience and not for people who perform CPU intensive activities.
I was skeptical about buying a high value product from flipkart but their service from packing to delivering is awesome. About the product ******************** u can read the specs and decide for urself but as far as real world performance is concerned this laptop is perfect for day to day work. I installed win 8.1 and its working like charm. I also played asphalt 8 airborne and its working fine. Dell support as usual is best in class. Will update my review after a month.
Reviewed after 4 days of use. Got it in ?21230 pros: Nice design. light weight. runs 1080p videos smoothly. battery backup 3.5 hrs. (though dell batteries loose efficiency fast) Windows 8.1 64bit runs line breeze. Targus backpack free (not mentioned in site) Cons: No Number pad Narrow Clear Viewing angle Buy it if budget is below ?25000 and if u r not a heavy gamer. Flipkart delivered in 3 days in Bhubaneswar. Packing was excellent with shock absorbing air pouches. Happy Flipkarting :D
Nice product & affordable price. good speed and nice design. Recommending this laptop for new developers.

I got it with Ubuntu preinstalled as per Flipkart with Laptop bag. The performance is Ok but not the fastest and not to be compared it with Intel i5 or i7 but the performance is not bad. It's a value for money. I install Windows 7 and i could get the laptop to connect to my home wifi and lan. So i googled for hours from my other laptop to get the Ethernet Driver , Wifi, Bluetooth driver and mother board driver. I wasted so much time and data of my home internet since most of the drivers i have downloaded failed to install or incompatible. At last everything worked fine out and Install cracked Windows 7. yay!!!
Best,ontime delivery mast product,value of money,best price than other sites, &got free Dell laptop bag
Bought this laptop a week back. About Delivery : Flipkart delivery was average this time as i received it in 3 days inspite of Jaipur being a capital city. About Laptop price : Perfect Deal. My requirement was a decently good looking laptop with min. pentium dual core. When I searched online this laptop perfectly fitted the bill. Moreover I was fortunate to get double discounts as while i was contemplating , Flipkart reduced its prices from approx. 23500 to 22100. And to top it , offer of 10 percent cashback on axis bank card made the deal irresistible for me . About the device : Received laptop in very well packed condition. Looks are very good and from no angle it looks cheap. Material is good though the upper lid is a bit flexible which seems less strong. Deleted ubuntu and installed Windows 7 on system and now its working like a charm. Currently not feeling any need for RAM upgrade but will make it 4 GB if required. ( investment of Rs. 1500 more ). Drivers were easy to find on Dell website. Battery life also seems to be very good in first impression. CONS : upper lid of laptop seems less robust. The Anti Virus of Mcafee provided is also out of date. So useless. In nutshell , very satisfied with the product and the deal. Will give further review after usage of a couple of months.
Thanks to Flipkart for its excellent Services. Despite of 2 non-working days, Flipkart delivered it in 3 days. Talking about the product, The first look itself will make you feel that the product worth more than what you have spent. The Grey color with Matt finish has blended like anything giving it an awesome view. The body is quite firm and the curve edges make it very comfortable to carry/work with. Processor is really good and is very fast. I have installed WINDOWS 8 which is working very smooth and the transition is nice. Camera is also nice and I quite like the way the speakers are placed at the top of keypad. The sound quality is also awesome as compared to some other notebooks I have used. Camera is 1.3 mp and works great for you purpose. Display is crisp and vibrant. Only one thing that bothers is the drivers as we have to download it from the Dell Website. But on a second thought, you can afford to take that pain to use such a masterpiece. Guys don't have any second though, Dell as always is the trust worthy and has really made this notebook very user friendly. I firmly recommend you this notebook. Thanks!
NICE & STURDY.... WELL PACKAGED... SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE DELIVERED PRODUCT.. THNKS ANIK GHOSH
It's Rocking product from Dell... [Main Points] => Chipset : Mobile HM77 Express = works superb (No other laptops have this) => Clock Speed : 2.4 GHz = gives speed like i5 Processor => Price : below 24000/- = reasonable (no need to spend high when you have simple works) => Look : it's 3rd gen. = feels like very hi-fi one with fine outside look (images in flipkart are older) => Accessories = 15 Month MaCfee Antivirus and average bagpack [Main Things to Think] => Keyboard : Chiclet Keyboard = without numbering keys => System Memory : 2 GB = low but is working (I am operating it with almost all things i.e. softwer, win. 7, Office 10, etc... ) => Graphics : Intel HD Graphics = not for those who want to play high definition games => Operating System : ubuntu = hard for windows user (had to install cracks) => Drivers : No CD/ DVD = had to Download from dell Website [All over] If you are student, Research Scholar, or SIMPLE USER it is worth to buy it then other one.(Dell Brand, smooth in working)
"awesome" features in this price. Best laptop at very low cost, good video clarity and really amazing battery backup. More Positive feedback: 1. Great video clarity. 2. Good Gaming. 4. In built camera clarity is good. i am going to purchase \m/____\m/
A good budgeted laptop, not suitable for heavy work and excellent for day to day work. Bought it two months back, so far no issues, working perfectly.
its an awesome product for everyday use in dell with lowest price, and i am impressed about its look n feel of the laptop.
I bought this laptop a week before , awesome product at such a cheaper price . Performance wise as of now i haven't faced any issues . Battery back-up is also decent . Speakers are not to good . Laptop keyboard panel has a fetching look . I got ubuntu preinstalled with this system , which is very good, only if you have some network issues then may be you will have to try some other flavours of ubuntu . Got one macafee antivirus cd with it . Overall if i picturise this product , I would recommend users that they can go ahead with this product if they want good laptop at a low budget Rate .
Bought in 22500 Rs from flipkart, free Dell Entry Backpack By Targus (944/- on flipkart), McAfee trial CD. body is platicky but it makes product light weight. Drivers can be easily downloaded from dell website. below are windows experience index: Processor 6.5 RAM 5.5 Graphics 4.5 gaming graphics 6.2 Hard disk 5.9 on scale of 1.0 to 7.9 (Max) Product has no issues like heating, hanging, installations etc. oh yes Display screen just awesome! easy to clean, no reflections. I have used INSPIRON n5010 (core i3 1st Generation, 3GB RAM, 36000/-) I feel this (Vostro) system gives good competition to above said system. Cons: keyboard does not give TVSE like feeling, without Numeric Pad, anyhow it is good only.
a very good laptop for this price believe me. good for multitasking, nothing like it should have been a core i3 atleast. no need. you can increase the graphics card performance for smoother gaming. no lagging at all till now even with 2gb ram, which we can upgrade to 8gb. looks great.
This is the first laptop purchase from flipkart. Wanted to gift it to my daughter, got on time and the product is good dell as always ...thanks.
Brought this laptop only for browsing and watching movie with little bit MS-OFFICE use. Laptop looks elegant. Loaded windows 7 which is working fine. No Drivers CD, need to download drivers from DELL official website.
just got the delivery of product.shipping time was average.but packaging was good.I have install win 7 on it and everything is working fine.I think this is a best laptop in this price range and it is suitable for day to day use. pros: Dell brand,good spec,sophisticated look,good screen quality. con: small keyboard, no separate numerical key section,you have to install drivers online. Dell have also provided a 15 month antivirus dvd inside the box.
If you plan to use laptop for browsing and movies, you dont need to put a huge amount for buying laptop. So I was searching for a laptop in a best price and I found this Dell Vostro 2520. Nice laptop, good experience.
pros:sturdy build,low heat generation,bright LCD display,light wieght cons:the keys are very crowed,doesn't have numpad(big disadvantage for dell),there is intermittent lag
Laptop is good price & speed and other function area very nice performance please select first this , function is very nice & good
i bought it for 21730/- its a very good offer. i am satisfied with the product. bag seems to be cheap but that's ok. screen clarity is very good. i suggest it for general purpose.
price was competitive, keyboard should have separate number keys price was competitive, keyboard should have separate number keys price was competitive, keyboard should have separate number keys price was competitive, keyboard should have separate number keys price was competitive, keyboard should have separate number keys
Decent specs for the money. Have installed Windows 7 ultimate. For basic needs, this should be a decent laptop. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now and it runs smoothly.
The Dell Vostro 2520 arrived in great shape within 2 days thanks to the quick deliver that can be expected from FLIPKART. And the cash-on-delivery is great. The Dell Vostro 2520 is versatile and rugged built to take the stress of everyday life. The best is the anti-glare display. It makes long hours of working a pleasure with no background lights reflecting in your eyes. It ships with Ubuntu operating system which is competitive and free alternative to Microsoft Windows. There may free applications developed for Ubuntu and available for download which can do all tasks that we are used to do with Windows. Nice Machine, great experience.
Good product. Value for money. Thanks to flipkart's comparison filter, you can see actual comparison here - http://www.flipkart.com/computer/compare?ids=COMDS2DGF7FRTK93,COMDQ3BHRWBCAZHV,COMDKQPGHKJN58MY
