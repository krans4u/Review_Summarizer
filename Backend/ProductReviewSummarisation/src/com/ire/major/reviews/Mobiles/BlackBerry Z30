BlackBerry Z30@@@Excellent featured phone but wifi keeps disconnecting.,,,,,,..........................................................................................................
The specs war is mostly on Android so I would not get into that as different OS optimises its functionality differently hence Apple uses dual core chip and sale iPhones in millions at a price point of above 50000/- and no one calls them a fool ! I had a mixed experience with Z30 and I would try to remain objective here ! 1) The Z30 is a great communication device and handles all your business and social media related needs effortlessly, the gesture based OS has its learning curve and it is exciting if you are a fan of gestures otherwise complicated. The on screen notification preview of your social feeds on BB 10.2 is a great feature but the issue is you can`t reply straight away from the screen unless it is a bbm message or else you have to do it by going back to the hub which is frankly a bummer. 2) The device has a low resolution display though the Super Amoled panel helps in some ways but for the price a better legible display could have been offered. 3) The device is a battery hauler thanks to its less demanding internals but the phone is quite heavy and the 170 grm weight is felt every moment of its usage. 4) The removable back panel is a flawed design as the battery is fixed and what it does is it devoid the user from having a unibody premium built. 5) The form factor of the device is nice but given it is huge and thick which makes it impossible to have a one hand use by the average users. Z30 is not for everyone but certainly not for no one as well , the lack of App is a developer issue and not an OS related problem ! My concern is whether Z30 is alluring enough to get users from other platforms or not ? cheers !
Comparing BB with Android and IOS seriously. someone even mentioned that bb was the first phone to be a hit.If you knew Motorola was the first company to come out with a hit phone i would suggest you to go for MOTO X or MOTO G
If you are comparing BB10 with Andriod, Windows or iOS then please read the following reviews. A smartphone is the one which satisfy all your needs without kill your daily routine. Blackberry is first smartphone maker long before Apple and Andriod which actually provide service without any glitch. Fact state that still there are many BBOS 2 , 3, 4 ,5 ,6 user in world . You must have seen BB flip phone which are actually discontinue for years.This is due to blackberry high self life of 5 years or more and support even after discontinuing of production.( please tell at least 10 out of thousand andriod phone which have such high self life) . Now let check Z30. 1. OS - its smooth , quick and upgradable to latest and upcoming os and free from crashes. Fact if Andriod crash 3 times and apple crash 1 and than BB 0 in a given year.( please tell at least 10 out of thousand andriod phone which will be upgrade to latest OS and upcoming os within 1 month of its release.) Don't listen to people who say it is hard to learn , believe me people who use andriod actaully don't know how to use it fully. Even iphone is hard to learn . 2. Screen - 5 inch and made in such a way that it can be use by single hand. (Please note anti blackberry reviewers don't write this in there review) 3. Apps - Blackberry provide most of its apps by building itself- Facebook, Twitter, weather , office documents, calender, Whatsapp , bbm , adobe reader, dropbox, compass, print, gtalk, yahoo messengers, password keeper, , travel, microsoft one drive and so on. This is done to protect users data to get free from snoopers. Now you download any extra app from amazon to bb. BB now allow andriod apps on there os. Please use only Amazon becuase after Apple and BB only Amazon makes multi check for malware apps before releasing. All beast developer like EA , Gameloft and even Rovio have there games for BBOS for Blackberry world itself. So virtually there is no term call ' lack of apps'. Every app is optimise for Z30 thus no compatibility issue. 4. Camera- if you think greater MP means greater picture quality then please read this. MP actaully means zooms , so higher MP means higher zoom. Remember Nokia 41MP camera add , it was actaully about zooming not quality. Camera of mobile depends on sensors .Check of camera quality of iphone 8MP and HTC 4 MP and any high MP camera you will find HTC wins!! If want to zoom buy standlone camera instead . Please don't look for camera in phone they don't stand a chance against standlone camera. Z30 camera is just good . Front camera need is just 1 MP but BB give 2MP which is great for Selfie. 5. Self life- as said atleast hope for 3 years. 6. Processors and RAM- Andriod phone need atleast 2 GB RAM to run wild. iPhone 5s run on 1 GB , so all those reviews who like high RAM phone they will hate iphone 5s . Will you too ?? RAM depends on phone OS . Blackberry gove high RAM to support and run its high end games. You can download high end games on any andriod phone but cannot run them because it will kill the phone. 7. Data - 16 GB is more than too much . 8. Speaker - Best of Best Speakers among all phones . Cannot believe me check Youtube. Please respect every brand. Blackberry has done mistake in past but everyone needs a second chances.
Worst phone ever. Been using it for a couple of days now, it's slow, un-intuitive and totally doesn't justify the price tag. No wonder BlackBerry is down in the dumps. With phones like these it's no surprise whatsoever.
Has Blackberry not learnt anythingfrom the Z10 epic fail. The cost of that phone has nearly reduced to half of its original selling price. The marketing guys at Blackberry really need 'Professional' advice. Come on it's not rocket science guys that a cell phone which has a complicated User Interface, next to none applications and nowadays as the fad is going Quad Core. People don't expect their 35k+ smartphone to be running on a Dual Core CPU. It solely depends on the phone as a matter of fact(Nokias work fabulously on Dual Core). Secondly I appreciate BB giving us a 2GB RAM but....arrgh do you have anything which requires more than 1GB of RAM. The phone at least needs one highlighting feature which sets it apart from all the competition in the market. For eg: 1. The HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia Z1 have fantastic Cameras.....hell even Gionee Elife E7 has a great cam too. 2. I've already mentioned my disappointment with the processor. I do like the fact that the phone has a 5 inch display. Full HD recording. They could've squished in a Full HD screen as well. The battery life seems to be good. Nonetheless I wish all the best to Blackberry with the phone. I also think there will be a rapid decrement in the price and this phone will be available in the sub 25k region if not the sub 20k region.
If you think this is a fan boy review,nope its not! I have a BB Z30 black and its a wonderful phone. The main demerit everyone says about BB is that it lacks app support. Well not anymore. BB OS 10 CAN RUN ANDROID APPS NOW. After the last update BB can download apk files directly from websites and install it(besides the apps from BB World). PROS: 1)Hardware is the best in smartphone world and has a premium touch to it. 2)Runs all app (both native apps and android apps) very well. 3)No lags,no reboots, snappy response. 4)No special subscriptions for using BB services like email and bbm necessary like on previous versions(OS 7). 5)New UI, fresh and innovative. OK BB has redefined the usual standards in UI. Its nothing like anything out there. UI unlike other phones does not having the same boring type of User Interface. 6)Got Dual speakers! So, blast them away! CONS: 1) Camera focus speed is slow.( very irritating sometimes). Again it can be fixed by a software update which i guess BB would soon do. 2) Doesn't have Quad core processors like most high end phones.( By the way,I felt no need for a Quad core processor as it crushed all the apps which i threw at it without even flinching). Thats all. Overall, I like the phone and is very very satisfied by it. PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO FOLKS WHO SAYS BB IS FINISHED EVEN WITHOUT USING IT. ITS NOT.
Do you think BB can come back now, well it as simple as never.Their service centres are now refusing to repair phones,and as of now BB is in such a bad financial position that it has sold a lot of its real-estate in Canada,don't believe me? go check out WSJ's website or simply google it.Secondly why would i spend 35K on a phone who's apps store is worst than Windows store. CONCLUSION If you have the so called common sense you would'nt have even read my comment and would have exited the page already. There are a lot better phones in the market, go with 'em
Its a great phone for both work and play. Amazing multitasking, can switch between apps without any lag or snaps...OS is really stable and intelligent. Definitely recommend. Display brightness could be improved - that's the only room for improvement
Even after blackberry mentioned in a press release that the Z30 will be available on flipkart for Rs 34,999. they are still selling it for Rs 39,999. When will flipkart stop this ? or will it ever ? now I am beginning to doubt it. It will anyway remove this review in a couple of days
a device that's awesome with best speaker yes better than htc one with blackberry os 10.2.1 it's a beast no can take down capable of running more than 5 lakh android apps with a s pixel layout display and a battery that will blow your mind it's nothing like anything it's beyond everything
Upgraded my phone from BB 9780 to BB Z30. Phone is impressive for a business user. Good Battery (Stays over a day and a half), BB 10 OS features are masterly. Display is very good. Apps that I use everyday comes pre-loaded with the phone. Would recommend the phone for any business user.
Absolutely amazing phone, simply love it.. Can't keep my hands off it.. Brilliant.. [Coming from HTC One > iPhone 5s > and now Z30] Pros: 1) Battery Life - Outstanding 2) Screen - 720P unlike other android phones, still stunning and crisp 3) Blackberry 10.2.1 OS.. Totally Gesture based, Butter Smooth 4) Blackberry Hub - Again brilliant thinking, a single place for all communications 5) Keypad - Best in the business, Flick to type absolutely great.. 6) Picture Password - Now crack this one and see if u can 7) New Antenna Technology - Now with my 5s & HTC One, used to constantly struggle with signals in office and ultimately the phone used to get super hot, not anymore, not sure the tech BB Z30 employs for Antenna, am getting almost a full signal so again very good Cons: 1) Apps - Native apps missing, though can download the Android APKs directly now after 10.2.1 hence that solves the issue to an extent, still need of Native apps is there 2) Lower Bezel could have been trimmed 3) Camera - Good, workable but not great, had a gr8 camera on 5s n HTC One hence missing it. PS: Its my individual opinion, my way of using a phone, dont want to start a war here for 5s or HTC one users, any phone that does your job the way you want is always best.. My case Z30 may b others 5s or One or S4 or Lumia or anything..
Blackberry Z30 is the best Phone with awesome concepts. Paratek Antenna never mentioned ever is the technology where u can get signal all the time even in a bad reception,with its dual antenna's which is the first phone ever. and the natural sound technology with four micro phones present around the device,better than HD sound. Now,the upcoming 10.2.1 OS can run any Android app directly. The one and only Phone which certified by NATO for Restricted Communications,the true power of Blackberry 10 OS. Blackberry 10 OS awesome features HUB,Remote File Access,Time Shift Mode and no of modes coming on the way,No of other features. No one knows these killer features because they just want to follow like sheep buying a Samsung or Apple. Just try It once and u never leave it. Initially u find it hard to learn but the learning curve is exponential. U WILL LOVE THE BB10.
Considering the amount of skepticism surrounding Blackberry, it was a very thoughtful and cautious decision to upgrade from Z10 to Z30. The packing of FLIPKART was horrible, phone came packed in a thin polythene, box was crushed. The machine inside, however, was such a beast that i forgot about the horrible packing and crushed box. Easily the best Blackberry till date, standby is rock solid, for a business user like me, cannot trust the security of an Android, which i do use, but not for business mails owing to security reasons. This beast of a machine is a blind buy, ignore all the noise surrounding Blackberry. Its a worthy upgrade from Z10 to Z30. Hardware quality is awesome not like all other made in China cell phones being marketed by all other Majors. Buy without any skepticism, its a beast!!
Wow! What a product! Definitely an iphone killer - if I have to compare. Have been using Blackberry since last 7 years and after using 9360 - which gave me lots of battery problem, was finally planning to move to iphone. But good sense prevailed and went through some user reviews of Z30. The screen size, my love for BB, looks made me go for this. Purchased from Flipkart. Got it on time - as usual nicely packaged. Now about the phone - have been using for a week. Pros: Superb interface, Quick. Excellent Motion sensor. Screen Size. BATTERY - A big plus. Security. Call quality. . One of the best OS in Blackberry 10. Hub Concept. Reminder etc etc etc. Can keep talking Cons: Camera at dim light doesn't give the best pictures. Package could have free memory card etc. Overall, this phone needs much more publicity. 13 K less than 5s - it is a manly phone and definitely the best Blackberry ever.
Come on guys what else one can expect from a phone? Look at the built, the screen, resolution, camera, processor speed, battery life, ...... other features !! It's jaw dropping at this price. Apple would have priced the same device at 60000/- bucks and samsung at 50000/-(if not higher). Please give it a high five. Don't buy blindly.... but if you look at it once, it's premium look & feel will definitely draw your mind to it. One word mind-boggling. :D
this is the best phn by blackberry ever. this is most wonderfull ever smartphn with a such powerfull battery and again its from BB10.2 os...which is best ever... its best substitute for Apple
There were many things that BB (RIM) did wrong and also there are many things that were against them. Time & again media have written them off saying BB wont see the ray of next dawn. However, BB kept on fighting & ultimately came with the BB Z10 fone. It is indeed a good fone but the pricing was really very, very bad. Had they priced it properly their story would have been different. Though critics, analysts & reviewers like the fone but media bashed BB like anything mostly for the unreasonable price tag. And the end result was almost a Billion $ loss. However, with BB Z10 & Q10 BB seems to have learned their lessons a hard way. Then came the Z30!! A truely true Smartphone. But unfortunately, people doesnt look or touch BB devices before giving their verdicts. Even before touching it they say itz one of the worst phone does not worth buying. But friends, dont just go by naysayers or misleading, uninformative and dishonest media reports. Go to a Showroom take a look at the fone, play with it for some time and then decide. Itz sure to delight u. I am not saying to buy it but just go and spend some time with it and then give your verdicts. No doubt you will obviously find less apps but honestly how many apps do we use??? very few..... apart from app gap (compared to iOS & Android) this fone is just awesome and has many useful & cleaver features that are really helpful and handy in our daily lives. Note: ** Unfortunate, in most of the outlets like mobilestore etc. BB always get the step daughterly treatment. The Sales guys (in most of the cases) will never put BB devices in the power plug so most often u'll find the devices are devoid of any juice and lying in the stores collecting dust. Even these sales guys will divert your mind to buy something else..... really sad!! God has given us a wonderful gift call brain so why should others decide for us?? Verify the Truth Yourself. Thank You
this phone, i think, was made in order to join the bandwagon of the large handhelds being introduced by everyone. I personally don't like the form factor. but BB has nailed this for the BB lovers and made everything right that Z10 fell short of. Hope Blackberry comes out with an improved Z10 incorporating this and more. that would be the perfect Smartphone. at 39,990 the price for Z30 is not too bad I think. And the company won't sink. Never!
This phone is amazing, but again, BlackBerry has priced it a bit high, it should have been between 30-35K. The BB10 OS is brilliant and BlackBerry is looking to survive the last battle, now with Thorsten Heins out, BlackBerry can revive itself with John Chen.
The Phone is being built with enormous mind effort for the Consumers,,who really like fast and smooth multitasking and many more reasons... But only the lack point is the Camera lens which pics are brilliant with daylights but at something any mild dark area it lacks...But overall 5 Stars for the Phone..
I bought a Z30 on 3rd in Delhi and I am loving it.. all modified and updated features of 10.2 are so darn brilliant.The battery is killer, I have been on it since yesterday on 3G Nd wifi almost all time and had charge it only once.. Awesome :D
Its a brilliant piece of work. No Chinese made rubbish here. Superb build quality, and the usual attention to detail that you can expect from the engineers at Waterloo. Very stable operating system. Memory expandable to 64GB. Solid battery life. And in the age of global snooping, it gives you the option of living without having Google looking over your shoulder all the time. Owing to the unpredictable future of BBRY, they had to do away with BIS. The upside of that is faster internet connectivity. The downside is that your data isn't encrypted any more. For the same reason I guess, the phone can run almost any Android app. Sideloads are widely available online. The only flaw I've noticed is a tendency for the battery to heat up a bit. And, there is no holster in the standard Indian package. (I didn't buy on flipkart, but in the market. Got it for 39k)
This is regarding price difference. Flipkart needs to look into like this misleading price difference in their reputed & branded site. How how you will sell the phone more than Blackberry launch price of around Rs.40,000/-. Even though these are minor mistakes as a long time customers of flipkart, it is very hard to see like this here. About phone, it is very good specifications and price is also ok compared to very high prices of Z10 & Q10 at the time launch.
