Sony Xperia Z1 Compact@@@I have buyed this phone on feb 2014 and it rocks. this is the beast in this small version. none of the other mobile can beat this in sound, style , camera.. all is excelent.
I bought the phone and it was really awesome and super cool but just used for 10 days and then it started creating problems. It got hanged 3 times in the matter of 10 days. Some times the main speaker do not work properly. Camera also showing blank images once and had to restart the phone. In all the phone gets 10/10 but the product i received must be a faulty one.
Been using it for the past 3 weeks without a single hitch. This is a performance beast, sometimes even surpassing the performance higher priced phones. Runs games such as Asphalt 8 and Contract Killer without any stutter. The camera is excellent for outdoor photography, but is left wanting under low-light conditions. Battery life is excellent and holds a minimum of a day and half with normal usage (Wifi, an hour of gaming, few hours of music a day). If you need a performer who stands out from the crowd and not from your pocket, then look no further. P.S: Unless you REALLY want to, don't upgrade the phone yet to Kitkat. Wait till all Kitkat bugs are sorted out before updating.
I had seen one of the exchange offers on flipkart so had thought of trying it..Placed order for Z1 Compact on Flipkart.Trust me they have awesome service.I a day gurantee is unbelievable. With regards to the phone Pros : 1.Fits in single hand.4.3 inch is fair enough size. 2.Camera : Can be used at it's best once you explore all the features of it 3. Trilumonous Display is smooth and great. 4.Phone doesn't hang up or lag. 5.Stamina Mode feature is great.Battery juice sustains for a long time when in stamina mode. 6.Looks wise its classy if the colour is Black.I don't know about other colours. 7.Memory is expandable till 64GB. Cons: 1.The waterproof resistant feature is a question mark,never really explored it. 2.Fingerprint marks are left on screen every time you use it. 3.Speaker volume is a bit low. 4.You cannot remove the battery from the phone. Great work from Sony in terms of price and the technology.Tough competitor for Samsung "S" Series phones.The distinguishing feature is that the phone is "Water Resistant".It can sustain for 30 Minutes under 1 meter water but there are some conditions and exceptions which Sony has mentioned in the manual and on the site.
The big problem with Android Phones till now was that all the flagship phones were way to big to fit in a regular pocket. I have been an iphone user for many years and still believe that IOS is amongst the most user friendly softwares in mobiles. But there were many things missing from iphone, due to which I finally shifted to Android. This shift was possible only due the Z1 Compact, as i never liked the big sized flagship phones. To introduce a phone with a 4.3 inch screen with all the features of the the flagship Z1 is a masterstroke from Sony. I have been using this phone for the past 2 days and am mighty pleased with the performance, battery life and especially the camera, which is way ahead of any other phone in the market. More to follow once i use the phone a bit more.
Ordered this phone on flipkart and got it today! nice packing! this phone is cute and is a beast in performance! very good display with good viewing angles! no lag at all! this is the phone FOR ALL THOSE WHO LOOK FOR GREAT SPECS BUT IN A COMPACT SIZE!
This is an amazing phone with all the features -I like it specially very useful mobile nd a campanion
Well,at first I wasn't sure whether to go for z1 compact after hearing about flash bleed issue.But I'm glad that I made the right choice by buying it.First of all,I have not experienced any flash bleed issue so far(I have a black unit and I click a lot of pics).Secondly,the looks are just awesome.It has got a pretty premium feel and though it is a bit heavy as compared to other devices but it only adds to its premium feel.Thirdly,it's super fast and I have played a lot of heavy graphic games without experiencing any lag or crash(Games like FIFA 14,NFS MW,MC4).The camera is superb and has a lot of interesting modes like AR effect,timeshift burst ,etc.Plus,the battery backup is pretty good and battery saving modes are great and effective as compared to the so called power saver by samsung.I highly recommend this phone to all those people who dream of having a powerful compact device but have to compromise on one or the other.
Beasty Snapdragon Processor, 2 Days of Battery Life with moderate use, One hand use, Perfect display, Waterproof, Expandable Memory, Quality Camera and Speakers, Zero Lag & Beautiful design. I dont think that I need to mention that this is what we all want in a phone. This is the second best phone after my Iphone and at almost half a price. Dont even think twice about the price and screen size, just buy.
I bought this phone 6days back. 2 main issues found on 4.3 and 4.4 android: 1. Phone doesn't connect to wifi with security type WPA/WPA2 PSK. I literally fought with the Sony CSR to make them understand the issue. 2. Working with camera or video playback makes Z1 hot like iron box!! (Adv - Small Travel Iron box) I lost all the respect to Sony after paying 40K! Please try these options before purchasing.
If you guys are attracted for Xperia Z1 or Z1 compact LOOKs , 20 MP camera & Waterproof device** ..... Then you guys need to re-think on buying this device. Its Just 6 days i purchased this device and faced 2 Main issues: i) WiFi connectivity issue - Most of the Xperia mobiles has this WiFi connectivity issue (WPA/WPA2 PSK). If you don't see this issue initially, once u upgrade the software that you will be facing this issue. (Confirmed by Sony service center). ii) Device gets HEATED up - If you r using this device for Gaming, downloads, sharing via Bluetooth, Watching video's , taking photos then this device gets heated up. And there is not resolution for this issue. Its design fault ! ! ! SO over all its a smart phone that do not give WiFi facility and HOT phone (heats up badly) Finally, I can give a caption for this brand as Sony Xperia - Smart Iron Box ..... Visit Sony website for more details on the same.
It's an awesome mobile with good display and great specs. The camera is excellent outdoor in well lit places. But average for indoor. Except that all is well.
So far so good! Bought the black z1 compact 3 days back (not from flipkart). So far very happy with it. I come from a lumia 920 (4.5 inch screen). So moving to 4.3 was not a big issue. Performance is awesome, very fast and responsive. The best thing about it is battery life. My lumia 920 used to die on me by 5pm if I pushed it a bit too far. I am struggling to drain this phone even after reaching home (midnight). I am not a big user of camera, so cannot comment on it. The battery life was my main reason to switch to z1 compact. If you are looking for a comfortable one handed experience with good battery and fast performance, this is the best that is currently available in the market (Android). PS: Get a good case/ screen guard coz as per reviews it is prone to get scratches. I got a flip cover free, so I am covered :)
Sexy looks, blazing fast performance, added protection with dust and waterproofing, and just about the perfect size for single-handed usage. Had the product delivered in a couple of days - amazing service as expected from Flipkart. The Z1C's price, though is uncomfortably close to the full-sized flagships, and feels psychologically incorrect to us Indians who usually relate size with value :)
I have been hearing tht phone has got flash bleed problems...has anyone of you all faced any issues?...it also says few few handsets are facing this issue..want to be very sure before i buy one...:)
i was been waiting for this phone from past 1 year. i impressed with its size and features Looking ahead to grab one ...
For all the people cribbing about the price. C'mon now. Do you realize how hard it is to get the specs of a 5 inch phone and pack it all in in this small a phone? That's some major achievement. Bigger does not always mean better. Z1 is not a higher variant of this phone - This is a compact version of Z1. People prefer the iPhones and such because of the size. Please get over the "bada hai toh behtar hai" mentality. For a launch price this is just right - for those who disagree I will now direct you to the Note 3 launch price of 50K? - coming from a guy who has to carry a bag every time he is riding a bike so he can carry his note 2 in it safely. People owning phablets will understand.
my personal experience abt Xperia Z1-C.. it's a beautiful device, absolutely seamless design, beautiful edges and lightweight (u'll find the device nicely managed in ur hands) Pros: 1. The display is absolutely brilliant, the very first thing which catches everyone's eye, the X-reality Triluminous display with bravia engine 2. (yea it's 720p bt ppl who r bragging abt not having 1080p, please also do consider the pixel density n it's a 4.3 in screen) 2. It packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974-AA, Quad Core processor, n it's unbelievably fast.It's smooth like butter n I haven't got any lag till now whatsoever even in slow 2G networks n weak signal. 3. The camera, and the apps, they are awesome except the time-shift burst app, it was a bit disappointing. And it lets u capture videos with 1080p res @30 fps. (i heard some ppl complaining abt not having 2160p recording or 4K videos, well let me tell u it has a Snapdragon 800 MSM8974-'AA' chip, it supports only 1080p max.) 4. Sound output in speakers is crystal clear n loud, even while call in 30% volume(without loudspeaker) i felt the other person is shouting on me. 5. Internal memory is 12gb usable, n 4gb for the Android OS, n total usable RAM is around 1680 mb. 6. New feature of WINDOWS TETHERING means if ur pc is Windows 8.1 yu can share ur internet just by connecting the USB, no need for any setting up. 7. Battery is awesome, 2300mah, even continuos 2G use + Wi-Fi + calling and texting (avg 4 hours) the phone lasts for 20 hours with the STAMINA MODE. A huge leap frm the previous versions, i have a Xperia S also, n i need to charge it twice a day frm the day i bought (now thrice) compared to tht i have to charge this baby once in 1.5 days. 8. Network: it has Bluetooth v4, Wi-fi 802.11 a/b/g/n , 4G LTE, Latest gen NFC with multi-tag capability n believe me, i'm in an area where the signal is weak, i had problems with the Xperia S, bt this has no problems, 2G works nice like 256Kbps broadband. 9. Glove mode, to use the phone in winters without removing ur gloves ;) Cons: 1. The build quality sure is awesome, bt doesn't feels premium considering the amnt u'll pay to buy. (well, it sounds weird,, bt i'm sure u'll feel it when the device is in ur hands) 2. It's a fingerprint magnet, better use two screen-guards, forward n back side, n always keep a cloth to clean. 3. Bundled headsets r WHITE. 4. Xperia S n Z1 Compact has the same screen size 4.3 in, bt still the screen in z1 Compact looks smaller bcoz of the home n back buttons over the screen. [no dedicated hard buttons for home n back like Xperia S]
I own this phone and here is my true xperience:- Advantages: 1.It is the first IPS panel screen from sony... Better viewing angles and more vivid than Z1. 2.Battery is 2300mAH is far more than enuf for 720p with 4.3"... Easily last for 1+ days. 3.Handy.. Can operate with one hand. 4.Its snapdragon 800 n 2gb RAM. RAM optimization is awesome in sony fons. It also has a feature to disable bloatwares that u dont want. 5. Like HTC this fon now has feature called 'Windows Tethering' meaning u can now share ur PCs internet to ur phone via bluetooth. 6. Camera is awesome. Gives natural photos n not saturated color photos unlyk samsung. Disadvantages: 1.Initially u might find the screen tad small than its competitors. But within a day of usage u will get used to it and find it handy and big enuf. 2. Plastic back.. It does feel premium n good quality unlyk samsung. I actually thot it was glass. But in a way its fyn coz the fons back will not shatter wen fallen unlyk z1. All in all its actually better than Z1 in terms of usability, weight n screen. That s d reason for being so close in pricing.
My friend has this phone and I've been using it for the last 2 days. It is a thick but very comfortable smartphone, considering it doesn't have a massive screen. 4.3 inches is the best screen size, and 720p display resolution is best for this screen. But the price is very unfair. I agree, all the specs are of high quality but you are saving a lot of money on small screen and low resolution screen. The difference between Z1 and Z1 compact should be approximately 5K. But, they are available at the same price. That is strange. Plus, Z1 is coming with bundled accessories such as screen guard and flip cover. That is not the case with Z1 compact. I am sure the price will come down in the coming days. If that happens, i would buy it over S4.
First of all, I've come specially over here to Flipkart to give a genuine review after watching many -ve reviews bout dis handset from flipkart app and decided to make some correction to those crap reviews given to dis handset. :) Secondly a request to Flipkart to delete all the comments over here specifically written for price cuz its from company itself, nor Flipkart selling on its own.. And now get to the review section, It actually a Phone u can't resist to buy if u use the demo piece over retail store or Crome Store. Frankly say, I was actually waitin' for dis phone from the past 6 months when Z1 first make its debut. The japanese company just withhold the device to see the market of Z1 Flagship to make some improvements to over Xperia Z which was the dream of Sony to make such device like Z series.. With Brilliant Camera and Power House bank of Chipset.. And then finally the time arrived when 6th January,2014 comes and I watch the releasing via stream, the launching of Beast XPERIA Z1 COMPACT... And next day I was having my B'day, I was very happy dat actually Sony make a device which will turn its way of offering fones in Compact size but NOT COMPACT SPECS..!! :D I fell in love wid dis device the day it launched in Japan named as Z1 F (The very same japanese verison). Got the fone on my hands on 24th February in Sony Authorize Store, and God Damn, the fone was actually WOWW... It feels too good while holding and swiping over the consecutive screens.. Perfect Premium Built, expect the Back Panel which was made of Plastic as confirmed by Sony by changing their view bout its manufacture in White Paper.. But dats not a big deal cuz Sony gives the Screen Protector in the BOX.. * Rest Turning to the point of Media Experience, The Sound is Mind-blowing and even compared to the HTC One.. * Video codec has been improved and added some other codecs like mkv, m4v, and might avi.. (Not Sure!!) * Display is Awesome, IPS Panel (Somehow Exactly The Same as Apple's Reality Display), No more comments on Display.. :p ;D *Snapdragon MSM8974 Quad-Core 2.2 Ghz, with Adreno 330 GPU (Almost Same Spec as Samsung Note 3 worth for 47,000 {Initial Price}) *X-Reality Display Engine with Sony LED's Triluminous Display for more accurate contrast and display *Award Winning Sony G Lens with Bionz Imaging Processor with 20.7 MP Camera.. *2300-Mah Battery with Stamina Mode, and Queue Background Data. The Best ever battery in 4 - 4.5 inch Mobile devices with upto 2 Days of Backup. (GSM-Arena nd Techradar Certified) *Active Noise Cancellation With A Dedicated Mic So dis is all I want to say bout dis beast device.. Since em having an Xperia P, which surely is a great device by Sony 2 years ago.. I don't want to sell my Xperia P, but couldn't resist myself to gain dis Holy Piece.. In short, Go with dis Mobile, dis is the Best Android Smartphone To Be Buy Ryte Now.. If u're planning to buy dis and price is ur real issue, den just wait for Xperia Z2 releasing in March dis year, Price drop r sure shot.. "I know every Phone is not the Best and Perfect, Dis one is just Right nd Adequate.."
Best phone in its class. Advantages over iphone - 1.Better specs 2.Lower price 3.More premium according to me 4.More availability of colors
i got this mobile last week....its amazing to use...i love sony brand. z1 features with compact size.camera is excellent. 20 MP.best of all.HD screen.
U get a better Battery ! U get a better screen ! A big screen ! at a less price ! Sony Xperia Z1 ! If u get a Big Package in a less price then why to spend more on a SMALL package !
I bought this phone a week back from Dubai, because i had the craze to the first user of this model in my town!!! Its an amazing One!! Its Camera is just stunning!! The speed of the phone is fantastic!! Its very handy and the best part i found is the battery backup which last for almost 36 hrs when your usage is to the extreme like Net, Movies, Games etc which has the potential to drain out the battery. XPERIA Z1 COMPACT a best ONE from SONY!!!
When iPhone is priced about 50,000 thousand people say it's the world's best smartphone. But when Sony releases a premium phone lower priced with better price and specifications people say its expensive. Come on Sony is always on the side of improvement if we see the display has been improved to ips too. In my views its the world's best mini smartphone and as far as about the price it will come down to 34 in few weeks or months so please don't hesitate to buy it. The phone is worth when you compare it with iPhone 5s. As z1 compact was only launched to take on 5s.
This is the only small size phone packing in premium hardware .It looks just like the Z1 with almost similar specs except Four : 1. Screen Size :- 4.3 Inches instead of 5 inch 2. Screen Quality :- 720p HD instead of full 1080p HD 3. Battery :- 2300Mah instead of 3000Mah. 4. Design :- Plastic back instead of glass Rest it keeps all the goodies of the Z1 that are : 1. Sexy Design 2. Water and Dust Proof 3. 20.7 Mega Pixel Camera 4. Snapdragon 800 Processor clocked at 2.2Ghz 5. Adreno 330 GPU 6. 2GB RAM Advantages of The Z1 Compact Over the Z1 : 1.Its much more convenient to operate with a single hand. 2.Despite the 2300Mah battery it has a great battery backup because of the 720p small size screen. Disadvantages of The Z1 Compact Over the Z1 : 1. Unlike the the Z1 , the back of the Z1 Compact is not glass , rather it is plastic and sony have now confirmed this. So the plastic back is more prone to scratches. 2. I Fell its a bit expensive comparing it with the Z1 . Keeping the fact that sony is using the 720p screen instead of the 1080p , I think they are saving a lot so they should price is somewhere around Rs 28000 to 30000 but i guess in a few months the price would eventually come near that. OVERALL ITS A GREAT BUY !!
I bought this phone today from a local showroom and found out the hard way that you cannot share pc internet to the phone using a usb cable. All other android phones like HTC will allow you to share your mobile internet to PC and PC internet to mobile via USB but this allows only to share mobile internet to the pc. this is done by sony to make sure you spend more on the internet and thus the carriers or network providers like airtel, verizon in USA will make more money from your phones. also it is a great security risk.the sim, memory card can be just taken out without opening any type of cover or lock. they are barebone open to everyone. you just lift the cover and eject it and your information is gone. there are no screenguards available for this yet so dont buy it yet. i got a 2 yr extended warranty,theft insurance,door2door pickup repair and drop facility.
A phone with everything (Amazing screen, dust proof,water proof, easy one handed operation, Nice camera , Superior build quality etc ) you could ask for .Forget the competition for a minute and how is this more expensive than its sibling - Xperia Z1 ?
Best in the Class for features, Best Look, yet... Price is the biggest drawback... How can it be expensive than its higher variant...Would be good if the price was around 30 thousand
Its more expensive than the Z1... In what world is this a possiblity... Except for the price fiasco its an awesome phone - used it, loved it... Good screen, awesome camera... If its priced under 30k nothing to beat this monster...
