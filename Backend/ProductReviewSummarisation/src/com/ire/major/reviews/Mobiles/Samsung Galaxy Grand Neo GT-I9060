Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo GT-I9060@@@Good Phone... with good processor, camera. Screen size is good. Multi Window feature is very well done.
Bakwaas Phone, better get Moto G, I dont konw what Samsung thinks 17k for this crappy devices.. Even it doesn't have HD Screen, Bulky, laggy, waste of money, I request dont buy this cheap product go for Moto G...
Don`t buy this phone. This is the very bad product from Samsung!!! The Screen Resolution is just most third class... Don`t spend so much money for this product...
big screen, good battery life and speed is good. No problem while running game. HD movie plays very smoothly. Processor is not judged on company only. Its processor is good what i felt.
bought the phone and enjoying it.Its a pretty good phone. I bought it from a local shop around 15,900 only with all flip cover and screen guard. Am loving the phone.
18k for this piece is equal to wasting your money Moto g worth 14k is three times better than this dont go just 'brandwise' trust me...this is shit
very good phone.it is not overpricing for a samsung product.i have downloaded 187 apps but this phone is not lose its speed.i have not buyed from flipkart.
samsung is launching a new model every week with the motive of extracting as much money as possible from Indian customers. instead of launching uncountable models in a year, they should launch a feature packed quality product with a realistic price. this new product grand neo not even comparable with moto g and xolo q1100 mobiles in terms of features. one can easily get better features than this grand neo in rs 14000.
Go home same sung, you are drunk... 18k for this less hardware featured mob.. Other companies mobile provide a lot better specifications in a much lower price....
This is really a very good phone when comparing to other phones: -> very fast -- 1.2 quad core processor with 1 GB RAM and with auto non-used processes killer s/w, does not haungs. -> Amazing battery backup -- Chipset is from broadcom which gives more power backup even when using with wifi. -> good quality -- does not produce heat -> More features -- like single handed, multi-window, etc... -> 5'' screen is really good with excellent touch sensitivity
Agreed its highly priced but it is not bad at all, - Screen is perfect - Touch is great - No lag at all - Good Battery - Crisp photos - photos taken in dark room also come up great, thanks to the fantastic flash.
i bought this phone yesterday its a really great phone like everyone i too had a great problem in finding a good mobile but at last i found 1 . This is really a good phone with all features. I would personally recomand this phone to everybody
Indian users have become very cautious... now a days everybody knows bout hardware and the hardware companies...Samsung uses broad com instead of mediatek but mtk is lot better ....its a worthless piece of s*it I have ever seen... my friend got this n now he is feeling bad ... so sad... better spend some bucks more and get a canvas knight
wat was samsung thinking heh ? yaar had h0ti hai kasam se yaar samsung chor khi ke booooo android is an open source ok price should be less !
This phone is overpriced, with same hardware XOLO Q1000 Opus is available at 8k. The resolution is very bad for 5 inch display. It is true for all Samsung phone I would say, This phone is better than Samsung galaxy quattro, but not even close to Moto G in performance. Samsung galaxy Core should be priced at 9k Samsung galaxy Quattro should be priced at 10k Samsung Galaxy grand neo should be priced 11k (Same hardware Xolo opus 8k) Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 should be priced 16K (Same hardware Moto G 16 GB 14K) Samsung should correct the pricing all the phones are overpriced. There is no point in launching the phone at high price and decreasing the price by time slowly, so better launch at affordable price, just learn from grand success of Moto G.
Samsung just dumping the old stuff in our country...Please release phones with international standards like s4 and note with SNAPDRAGON 800 not with your old Exynos chip.
Same configuration except two more cores.... And the price is INR 17000/- It's better to go with Motorola MotoG................................
highly over priced device from samsung. according to its specs it should not be priced anything above 14k. can not understand what samsung thinks of indian citizens! who's gonna buy this piece of crap fr 18k??

Definitely Samsung starts to think that we Indians are totally retarded so we'll buy whatever crap he launch. Seriously wanna sell this crappy plastic in 19000 INR? lmfao :D 1 Star for Samsung 5 Star for Flipkart
what the f**k samsung cheap phone in premium price .samsung going on the same way like nokia and everybody knows what happens to them that can also we see in future with samsung.cheap quality ,display,ram,body,and samsung allready booked moto g
This handset is highly overpriced. The correct price for this is no more than 12k. it might even sell at 13k. will sell like hot cake at 11k. but at 18+, anyone buying this set is has to be a die-hard samsung fan. I see no reason whatsoever to buy this set at 18399.

Pathetic screen resolution, pathetic brodcom processor, pathetic boring design and cheap all plastic built. Not even a matt finish! Moto g priced at 12,499 runs over grand neo. Moto g destroys this stinky smelly grand neo who needs a deo.
