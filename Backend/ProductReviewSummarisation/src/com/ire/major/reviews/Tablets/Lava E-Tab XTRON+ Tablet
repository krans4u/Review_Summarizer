Lava E-Tab XTRON+ Tablet@@@i bought this tab and got it delivered in 2 days.there was no lag in the games. pros: has good battery can play high end games resolved cons: youtube app:some say that an error was displayed while playing.if u had experienced it,try this-go to settings->under apps->select youtube app->select clear data
Lava E-Tab xtron tablet is good I am unable to connect Internet through wifi manual is ok. There is no proxy settings. Battery very fast discharging.
Tab works great and for this price of under 5K you can never expect a better tab. Flipkart delivery is as usually within 2 days.
After seeing such a good reviews on flipkar and even satisfactory review from friend. I bought this tablet but it but very much disappointed when it starts hanging and automatically shouting down,I even cannot use Skype and video calls and top of that when I complained about it the seller completely deny for replacing or assistance for getting it rectified. So I feel it's complete waist of money. I could have bought some better brand than this LAVA
this is very good for this price but having low space in application area. due to which we cant load the app in full strenght and the high end app are getting legging in performance
It's really good.I am really helpful.You must try this product.it's used topmost technology.I think we all must buy it.No complain from my side.I am very happy and satisfied by using this.thankyou
i purchased this tab from flipkart one year ago till date this tab has functiones awesome some people might complain that it hangs for a few seconds when it starts up but its like a small computer right there in your hand best specs u can get for 5 grand even nexus doesnt provide such a great gaming experience just the company should consider adding a sim slot, bluetooth , good speakers and a good camera ; ---- doesnt matter if they take 1.5 grand xtra, if it is so this would be the best tab at this price range very good for rough and tough use
when playing hd games like asphalt 7,8 it hangs and touch is not response and after few days i am used whats app vice record is not touch longer time......
Got it on the next day of order.. the tab is really awsum at this price range... But sometimes it lags but thats ok no problem at all..
The Tab I received is Great Ek Dum Paisa Wasoool and Many Thanks To Flipkart for Instant Delivery and Genuine Product
I ORDER IT ON 25TH MARCH AND I GOT IT ON 27 MARCH AT SHARP 1.30 PM .I PAID ON CASH DELIVERY. I LIKED THE TAB IT HAS NICE AND SMOOTH TOUCH .AND VIDEO CELERIATY. IT IS HAVE GOD GRAPHICS AND BATTERY BACK IT WORKS FOR 7-9 HRS .THE ONLY THING I AM SAD THAT IT HAS NO CALLING FACLLITY .
I have placed order yesterday. I surprised within 24 hours I got delivery of Tablet. Its good as per budget Rs 4999. Camera is also good. Backup have to check. I purchased this Tablet for my son on his upcoming 5th B'day. I think its best Tablet in this price range. I will write my experience about this tablet later.
I got this tablet 4 days, after I ordered from flipkart. Great service by flipkart! Now i will give an exceptionally detailed point wise review. 1. The tablet's looks and build are excellent, the aluminum build, the feel and grip are great. 2.Display: Its resolution is far better than those in its class but brightness and touch sensitivity is not up-to the mark. Sunlight readability is terrible. 3.Battery; Its terrible, on full brightness you be lucky to get 2.5 hours surfing time.Although, the charging takes only 2 hours if airplane mode is switched off. 4. Accessories: This part got my blood pressure up, lava gave no usb data cable, the o.t.g cable was flimsy,the earphones look like those you get for 20rs in the streets, though sound quality is good. The charger is too short . 5.Connectivity: If you wanna buy this tablet for INTERNET usage only than go buy something else.Cause wifi has only a range of about 10 feet. Not to mention the lack of dongle support,heck no dongle has worked with it yet.My micromax mmx 353g didn't work neither did Airtel Huawei E1731 work which it says on the spec's page works. Seriously go buy something else if you wanna browse. 6. Multimedia: The videos don't get played in full screen, i mean they do, but some part of the screen is taken up by back,home buttons. Checking images is good and crisp. But music and video playback is cr*p cause of those tiny little speakers that are worthless. Ain't no use if you wanna watch a video with your girlfriend cause she wont hear sh*t. Not too mention, because of the ugly viewing angles, she wont see shit either! 7.Gaming:Thats one perspective of this tablet that astonished me. In other words, if you want a gaming tablet, this is it, at this price range. 8.U.I: Shi*ty! the c*ck s**kers at lava just took the stock jelly bean o.s and inserted it directly on this tablet. without prior modification. You switch off airplane mode and this fuc*** tablet starts looking for signals and consumes your battery. 9.HDMI: I called lava customer care to ask what kind of Hdmi does it support? they said mini hdmi. Sadly those pathetic degenerates were wrong about that too. Honestly lava! You lure the customer by showing its massive features, and than screw him. The tablet has 8G memory of which 5GB is available and of which 500 MB is internal memory and apps get stored there. Though you can move apps to 5GB nand flash. Its fuckin useless cause 10% of the app stays in the internal memory. Not too mention you get only 384MB of the 500MB and once you update your gmail, maps, chrome, and install facebook app. The camera is ordinary although didn't expect miracles at thsi price. My advice save the money and buy something better and greater`.
After the replacement, I am happy with the product and if you look at the budget, this is the best deal. Specially for gaming and kids, amazing Tab. Look & feel nice and touch sensitivity is also. I would recommend to buy this to every one and you will not be let down.
Bought this at Flipcart, value for money.....is fast with games and also has a whole lot of features at such a low price. Comes preloaded with Android 4.2.2. Go for it.
i used this tab for about 10 days .it has been great tab for gaming . games like gta sandreas, mc4, asphalt 8 , maxpayne , gta 3 which r high graphic games , work great on this device . the only thing which bothers me is that the device has a bad display and bad battery . other than that no problem . best tab for that range
I purchased two of these tabs for my both kids, Earlier I had Micromax P275 but both started giving problems, Their touch had broken and could only be used with a mouse, so I disposed them off, Thankx to OLX I got these tabs around 15 days back as I had a family travel for 1 week and kids become bored while travelling and tab needed to keep them company. As for tabs I got these for the specs mentioned and I should say that they have not disappointed. Please note that I have not used Samsung Tab or I pad or Nexus, My experience is purely based on my past Micromax I have installed many games into them and NEVER I have faces a lag or judder. Tab comes with proper screen protector and that has stayed the heavy abuse of my 3 yr old kid Screen is good and resolution is also nice, I am comfortable reading my emails of PDF files. Battery back up is very good, probably around 6-7 hrs in usage There are few cons 1> charger wire is only 2.5 ft long????? what the hell will LAVA save with aditional 1.5 ft of wire. The wire is so small that it cannot be used at most of the places unless there is a place to keep your tab while charging. I am planning to cut and extend it after 6 month warranty is over. 2> Charging time is dismissal. I believe it takes over 4-5 hrs to fully charge the tab. 3>I tried Samsung charger buy it didn't take micro USB charging 4> Most of the covers available in local market here do not fit as the tab is larger with almost 1 inch frame outside screen I would recommend this tab to anyone who wants good specs and performance. and at good price
| HARDWARE |:-: Talking about the Lava Xtron+’s hardware, the tablet boasts a dual core Cortex A9 CPU with each core clocked at 1.5Ghz and a Mali 400 Quad Core GPU. Well, for the proof of graphics power, see the most helpful review here ,63.9 fps in nenamark, and the most important thing according to me, RK3066 IS THE BEST LAST GEN GAMING CHIPSET BETTER THAN TEGRA 3...I am a true geek and after searching for 20+ hours came to a conclusion that this is the best piece of android till 12-13k,(except Lumia 520 but it is windows).. | BATTERY | :-:Coming on to battery, When I opened the battery stats page I find that Cell standby had consumed nearly 60% of the battery.WHAT!? Cell standby is the battery used by radio cells for mobile networks. This tablet DOES NOT have cell radio! The engineers working on this tablet didn't even bother to setup the OS properly and instead chose to simply download Android 4.2, flashed it in the tablet and have put it up on sale. The Flipkart page reports the battery capacity to be 3,700mAh, which is probably wrong since the official specifications page on Lava’s website reports it to be only 3,000mAh. I can't be sure.. AIRPLANE MODE IS NOT COMPLETELY WORKING DUE TO DEFECTIVE DRIVERS (CELL RADIO DRIVERS ARE PRESENT IN THIS TAB SO IT SEARCHES FOR DRIVERS CONTINUOUSLY AND FUC*S BATTERY UP!) | SCREEN |:-:The front of the Lava Xtron+ holds a 7-inch sharp IPS LCD display having a resolution of 1024 x 600. It’s a bright screen and with a pixel density of 170 PPI, it is pretty sharp too. The best part about the display is that, despite being an LCD screen, it’s not a battery consuming monster. I always found its battery usage to be lower than processes. The screen is prone to scratches though and is highly reflective. NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE ROOTING (one more time) ROOTING! Here is the method tested by me... First of all , I am not responsible if it bricks your device.(Don't come complaining if it does!) 1) Install moborobo and it will download the required drivers for you. 2)In your tablet go to in Settings , find developers option and turn it on and enable USB Debugging. 3)Before connecting it to your PC( it works only windows ) go into the tab's settings again and click on storage.In it you will find 3 dots in top right hand corner.Click on it and USB computer connection will be there.In it select the storage to Mass storage. 4)Connect it to your PC and let moborobo download the drivers. 5)Now install the software from the attached file given in this post. 6)It is a Chinese software so click yes on all prompts during installation. 7)after it is installed it will open. 8)wait for it to detect your device and then there will be a window on the right hand side showing the statistics of your device. 9)in last statistic it should look like this: Root?? ON>>nE . 10)then click on option ??Root.T 11)It will have a prompt showing a tick mark in the center and 3 rectangles below of the colour of blue , red and green.Click on the green box. 12)Then the tool will start its work.DO NOT INTERRUPT ANYTHING AND CLICK YES( green colour means yes ) TO EVERY PROMP IF IT ASKS YOU. 13)It will restart your device and an app called superuser will be pre-installed.I recommend you downloading another superuser. 14)Download root checker to check whether the root was successful or not. Worked on my LAVA ETAB XTRON+ Note: DO not turn on usb mass storage (when connected to pc)connection. Note:Remove your external SD card before rooting. Note:If your device detects Nand flash as sd card then no need to disconnect it. and now how to fix battery:-: Get root explorer open system/app and rename phone .apk and telephonesomething.apk to phone.bak and telephonysomething.bak, you are good to go.. I had waited and checked price for everyday for the past month and bought when the price got to 5000, now, value is unbearable, polish, hardware, battery and everything is so awesome it almost brought me to tears of joy! the only con that I could find is that less games are supported than Tegra 3 still, next gen games should be supported most probably.. EDIT: OTG cable works with pendrives (don't have external hdd), and there is no way of getting official USB drivers I am not even able to set "ADB" up, and charger is last gen..but I don't have a problem with it as long as it doesn't create any problems, Just checked Wifi, works flawlessly |note|: is it my first use of wifi so no comparison...OMG I left one thing out We can enable the biggest part of pc gaming in android nnow, i.e 4xMSAA in settings PLEASE HIT THUMBS UP AS EVERYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
A low cost tab .... pros: look is good game like temple run , sub way surfers run with out any lag supports any video format Reading pdf is also decent cons: I am a bit confused why its not able to get 3G connection while connected via dongle ... Also its my request if anybody knows any trick regarding that plz update that review in detail ....(Although I did not try wi fi) Display brightness is not up to the mark camera is not a thing what I was looking for but dont expect a good one. 3D games are not supported too
i bought this tab one 1 month ago and found that this tablet has many features that are provided in the price range of 10-15 thousands but lava is giving this tab in 5000 only........that's really amazing. My performance experience with this tablet is very good till. Its better than my expectations, keep it up lava, and thanks to flipkart !!!!!!!!
For one who looking for low end usage this is ok. problem is Low audio output, touch sensor is not good. But this support OTG i can able to connect usb devices, also this has HDMI port and micro SD are really good.
Had been a little sceptical before purchase. Writing this review after several months of using. Satisfied. But check which USB modem can be compatible with it - not all USB modems are compatible. I've been using my smartphone's wi-fi.
I bought this after reading all the comments. I am writing this after 2 days of using. Video is good. youtube works fine. Sound could have been better. Quality of accessories is sad. You can not charge using USB. Skype doesnt work. Hangout is OK OK, video streaming is not good, voice keeps breaking. But for watching online videos, checking mails, social media access is good and simply worth the price.
good deal for the money but if the following are improved ... it will be the best product 1. wifi strength 2. Viewing angels 3. speaker sound 4. reducing weight 5. with SIM
There have been a lot of negative reviews about battery issues plaguing this tablet. However, most issues arise when the end user does not heed clear instructions. 1. Only use the manufacturer's charger for charging purposes. USB charging is also discouraged as it will increase charging times. (This is a lot of conditions, but if you want battery life, these should be followed.) 2. Switch off wifi when not being used, and turn ON airplane mode. (Really improves battery) 3. Turn off all apps before keeping on standby, as these apps continue to drain battery otherwise. Considering every other aspect, the tablet is totally worth the money and completely exceeded all my expectations. Installed around 20 games, and all of them work really smoothly- Asphalt8, Dead Trigger, Into the Dead, and a load of other games. I've seen a fair share of tablets, and this ne has probably got one of the best build quality. Really good video playback. Really good EVERYTHING. At Rs.4950, probably the best deal ever. Hope no battery issues crop up in the future though. Presently, thoroughly impressed.
i ordered this tab on 12march and received it today at the offer price 4949rs only. this tab is specially meant for gamers. it has very bright display (IPS). it scores well in all benchmarks. people who are criticising its camera should know that they're paying 5-6k,so please don't expect dslr's picture quality. battery is somewhat an issue as it may take more than 3hours to get fully charge. looks and feel of this tab is very decent,it doesn't feels like cheap plastic like other tablet in this price range. at 5.5k lava is offering the configuration(1gb ram,quad core gpu, dual core cpu) for which other companies are charging more than 7k. so this tab is highly recommend to the gamers and people looking for call facility may stay away from this as it's clearly stated in its specifications that it's not a calling tab. I've tested Frontline Commando2, Critical Strike, riptide gp2 and all runs smoothly@60fps without any glitch. solutions to problems people are having with this tab: 1.Battery issue: turn Airplane mode on, turn HDMI off from setting, turn wireless playback off from display menu, set bright ness to low levels, set auto rotation off when not in use. 2.Non availability of Bluetooth option: for this you can use WIFI FILE TRANSFER apps which are easily available on playstore. 3.low internal memory issue: internal memory is 503mb+5.80gb, in 503 mb only apk will be stored, you can use option MOVE TO SD CARD to move the apk's data to sd card as most of the apk generally ranges 10-30mb so you can store lots of apks in it. finally thanks flipkart for providing valuable products at reasonable price :)
Hi people ,I ordered this tablet on March12th on that it was 5039 including a day guarantee delivery.As said I received the order on 13th evening.But the shocking thing is It is not even switching on right from the time of delivery .When I placed Return request,It was also cancelled. I dint expect this from flipkart.People dont buy this product and loose your money .
Its good but not perfect it not has blutooth for file sharing and wi fi direct not work connect with other device . and unlocked dongle not support, I bought iball 3g dongle for access internet but it not detected by tablet, then it is useless.
If you want experience the the worst possible support kindly order with flipkart .It is 10 days up still know one from flipkart has come to replace the tablet and my service they have even cancelled my retutn request without any confirmation from me whether product is working fine or not after the trouble shoot. rating i want to give minus 100
Go for it Junta. Seriously, you wont get anything better in this amount of money. 1.5 Ghz dual core and 1GB RAM and 400 mali graphics!!! Dude it is a big deal if you ask me. I boght it as soon as I saw it on Flipkart
The product is good and delivery in nice way..best product at this price..except bettery of the tablet is problem but acceptable...
I am writing the first time after used the tablet nearly one week. Pros: Display : Very Good Gaming : Very Good Cons: Battery - Worst.Max 20 mins to 30 mins and need to charge around 4 to 5 hrs for full charging.
I purchased this product this week and got delivered on Sunday 9th March. When I received the tab I charged it fully before using, it took around 6-7 hours to charge. I could not use tab much on Mon and Tue, but today when I got time I wanted to browse through, I saw that the battery is only 20%, I shutdown the tab and then put on charging, when it charged 100%, I switched off the power supply and went out for an hour. After I came back and started the tab, it was only 33% battery left, I was surprised that tab is eating up battery even in shutdown mode, how is that possible? Anyone has faced the same issue or any solution to it before I talk to flipkart to replace it?
Well I am Telling this after a weeks use. Pros : 1.Good battery backup upto 6-8 hours average on usage of wifi with background download from torrents & playing Games or Watching movies. 2.Very Clear & crisp display of movies of Blue-ray rip. 3.Storage is Good and additional SD card support is very good. 4.Packing is Above average & Delivery by Flip-kart is good and responsive. 5. Cost considering this Tab is Low compared to Rivals. 6.Built quality is good, better then any in this price range Cons: 1. Poor viewing angle 2.No Direct usb support,But you can use Usb items via OTG cable provided. 3.Tablet does not charge via PC when connected by data cable. 4.poor audio out put by inbuilt speaker,but speaker quality of headset is better and good. 5.Charge wire is short,it could have been little longer. I have some issues while connecting to INTERNET via ZTE usb MF190 dongle (it connects automatically but disconnects after 2 minutes).I Apart from the problem Tablet is really good and a Must Buy for people who have budget around 6000 Rs. 6.
Tab is excellent in the price you pay. - Great touch. - Good battery life. - No lag at all. - Good resolution for movies. - HD games are fab to play. - Built quality is good, better then any in this price range.
cheap made in china. bought lava e-tab for 5500rs on flipkart. still have the fuck hardware. stopped working after 2 days. I will spend 10-12k rs and buy samsung and go to hell lava and other cheapo companies. rating if -zero 00000000000 but 1 sucks LAVA
Actually I had first gone through reviews of flipkart so I ordered this after having this really its ausum graphics features and gaming experience really good sound is not that good without earphone and with earphone its mashalla ... Camera has very poor quality overall at 6000 its very good for that thing I am giving this tab a four star. So users don't wait go and grab it its really a cool tab .....:)
This tab has a good graphics supports and this is definitely a good performer while playing games. Build quality is also good. The tablet has aluminium build and curved corners which gives the tablet a premium look. Display and touch are average. Camera has poor quality and sound is also not great. The tablet doesn’t have USB charging option so the charger should be carried along with tablet. This tab has only 504 MB internal storage and 5.85GB flash memory available for user. Although many of the apps can be moved to flash memory, every app consumes some space in internal storage and some apps cannot be moved also. So we cannot install many apps as the 504MB internal storage gets full very easily. This tab doesn’t have Bluetooth but we can use Wi-Fi file sharing apps such as Flash Transfer, SuperBeam etc. to exchange files. Pros: • Good build quality • Good performance and graphics support • HDMI out • Data card support Cons: • No SIM slot • No Bluetooth • No USB charging • Only 504MB internal storage is available to user for installing apps
WS Retail service is the best. As far as the product is concerned, I am satisfied with the performance and overall features. Those interested to avail BT services, need to lookout for some other brand
Good tab within the budget.. Gifted it to brother... He uses it to watch movies and play games,... Very nice tab.. Thanks to flipkart for the prompt delivery..
I just bought this tab... its a best one... here it can support most of the data card that can connect 3g.... I recently using huawei e3121.......... it connect smoothly... But you must go to setting->data usage (more)->on airplane mode->click mobile network... then filed require options... Now you can easily connect most of data cards............ Here, also support all video even HD.... actually 1024*600 resolution superb in this price!!!!!!! Touch respond is best ever... i think!!!!!!!! android 4.2.2 jelly beam.... wow!!! =>1.5 GHz Cortex-A9 Dual Core (so speed, don't take any time to open any apps or files) .... FOR ALL ITS A BEST TABLETS IN THIS PRIZES RANGES... But there is a some drawback, but its very small that there is no Bluetooth, and no call facility.... and low volume sounds... but you can use headset and its good one...(if you use lava, which is come in this tablets) After all best tablets............ it can read any document like PDF, OFFICE, PNG etc... you can connect pen drive via OTG... you connect your laptops via USB ,,,, easy to use anything........... AND thanks to flipkart for the quick delivery.... BEST TABLETS, GRAB IT IF YOU LOOKING IN THIS PRIZES..........
it is super but bluth callinsystemis not there all can buy this iyt is having a graphis other things sr
Pros Excellent RAM Gaming is good Stylish Saavn comes with this Cons Disgusting battery backup. I charged it up fully,closed all apps,cleared cache and went to bed. The next day, when i clicked the power button it gave the message connect to charger 5 percent remaining Apart from this nothing bad
poooooooor wifi connectivity...accessories are not available anywhere.... its your luck...7 out of 10 have battery problem after 2 months...and service centers are a total disaster....don't buy it... the first one i bought got dead after few days...the replacement is in the service center...lava itself doesn't recognize the serial no. of this tablet.. customer care is crap.. they charge for the call you make and often say you to hold the line...after few minutes they will disconnect the call... i would have given -ve rating....if it was possible... don't buy it.. don't.
Good featured TAB at such low price of 6K. USB cable to connect USB stick, 3G Dongle, key board, Mouse etc. No GPS, No bluetooth make little bad rating.
xtron plus is a powerfull tablet from lava ,, battery back up is good , camera is like kaam chalaaoo , prossesor is so powerfull , graphics is very good , tablet is so strong by body too , its my first product from lava but very good experience from lava ,,, some time i want to say better than micromax too , but i got with damaged otg usb cable so some dissatisfied from that , otherwise tablet is very good , i could give it five star if usb otg cable would be undammaged ,,,, thank u .... One more qust. I want to ask from the buyers and sellers that would u plz suggest me a universal modem for this tab ?????
apart from low battery life and sound quality everything else is good....no lags while playing games..touch screen is also sensitive enough...
This is good product. All config is ok. 6Gb internal memory is usable, but we can install application in 512 MB only. Other memory is considered as SD card. This is bad. This is only the main drawback.
I purchased this product via flipkart recently for 6K. Pros- I was looking for budget tablet and had Nexus 2012, Lenovo a1000/3000, ASUS FonePad and similar in mind. But Lava xtron+ had best processor speed 1.5Ghz, 1GB RAM, and a GPU unit, so i choose to buy this product. The display is very nice and touch screen experience is very good. The youtube app works well. Cons- (Not that of problem) 1. Not a standard 7 inch size and I tried to get a tablet book cover from local market but was not able to get it as this is little wider than the usual. 2. The microSD card protrudes a bit out of the body when inserted 3. The AC adapter wire length is around
it does not support HD video play... but for other purpose it is fine.
Tablet works well and i did not experience any issues, battery gives good playtime after switching to aeroplane mode and guys we can Root this tablet very easily using (kingoapp) program it's not app for tablet but for pc download it ,install it, connect your tablet and follow onscreen instructions and you can root your tablet in no time. overall good tablet with good features and unbeatable in this price range.
Merits: 1.Very slim and good looking and handy much ahead of others. 2.Games like Temple run and subway surfer run super smooth with highest quality. 3.Super fine touch. 4.dual core processor. 5.8 gb internal memory. Demerits: 1.No blue tooth. 2.Battery drains out within 4 hours if game runs. 3.Camera needs sunlight to work fine. 4.No sim facility.
i bought lava xtron plus tab and l found may complaints first thing is that about its battery the battery takes nearly 4 hours for a complete charge. 2.bad wifi 3.bad camera and speaker 4. very bad customer care service i bought this product and within 4 months the camera and speaker stopped working i called flipkart and got an authorized lava service center in mysore.They kept my tab for 1 month saying that camera is not in stock.i waited for a month and i got the product without fixing both the camera and speaker. when i got the product the tab was off and there were no battery charge. i went back to my home put the tab for charging and found that the service center me.
I purchased 2 tablets on Flipkart for the kids. The tablet is fine for all basic operation, however it takes quite some time for charging. The WiFi speed is very slow (same issue seen on both the laptops). Even direct transfer between the two tablets was quite slow. Screen viewing angle is also not that great but ok for a budget tablet. The other big issue is built in speaker volume which is very very low.
It a good gadget in such price range. But battery not seems good. Even battery charges I got with Tab not working. Getting problem to get another charger from open market....
One of best tabs available in the market, never hangs, come what may...plays everything and anything..and runs all what I play.....volume, yes is at the lower side..bt that can be managed with a decent ear plug..n has a decent battery bckup of 3-4 hour (movie play).. Worth every penny..trust me..I hv tried micromax and intex..both
wat to comment m already excited to have this tab ...m still in a doubt how did they price it so low .... i mean it cud have easily sold in 10000/- ....build quality n performance really unparalleled at this price .... i guess there were 10 stars to rate !!
This is one of the best tab in this price range with android 4.2.2. Pros : Display is too good. android jelly bean OS. 1 GB ram Slim and sleek look Cons: Battery Back up very low. Remember as I mentioned earlier that this tab best in this price range you cant compare it with costliest one
Display is very dull and to use internet through wifi you need to sit beside your wifi modem. even if you move a bit aside you will loose wifi connectivity. And Lava customer care, one of the worst of it kind. People who sit in so called customer care doesn't know what is micro HDMI and mini HDMI port. As this tablet has HDMI port, so wanted to connect it to TV so that I can enjoy HD movies on bigger screen. So I do not have any clue what kind of HDMI cable it supports (nothing mentioned in booklet provided along with). So to know about it's port type I contacted Lava care and they confirmed me it as micro port. And I bought a micro HDMI cable (spent 1500 bucks), then i found it is not micro port, but it is mini port. I lost my 1500 and need to buy new cable now. Even Application installed in this tablet and use less and they are not of any use. Never ever buy any LAVA products.
i love this tablet its really awsome but it is lil heavy then other tab pre installed waste application which trouble memmory alot google chrome installed in tab internal tab mememory or say device memmory which eats lots of space 5 stars gamming expirence i had please buy cover with this tab it gives electric shok when it is in charging due to metal body cemeras 3rd class itis poor dont buy if you need a tab for vedio chating only get get all togethers its best due to dual core processor like i hope gammers only buyit and not contain gps its sad ..... :|
This is really nice tablet for the begineers. It is really worth buying as the price range is better. of course compromise few issues ( reflecting display, Angled view is not good). 3G I did not tried connect using dongle.
The product is amazing and the packing, delivery was too fast as expected. You cann't get better than this product in Rs.5990. Everything works great, a quality is awesome, must buy. But if your budget is Rs.8000 then i would prefer you to buy Dell Venue....
when i install asphalt 7 it opens shows screen then close what to do now..... this proves that it is not gaming tab....
pro ram 1 gb game resluation screen easy touch battery life very good internal memory processor daul core con memory for app just 512
Battery Life is good lasting around 4 hours. Internal memory available is only around 500MB which is not enough for games like Angry Birds Go. Video graphics are good.
The tablet is good but there were some scratches on the screen. I don't know how they came over it may be I these are since the manufactured time or by flipkart.... But awesome delivery...
I BOUGHT IT IN A RETAILER SHOP FOR AN EXCHANGE I CANNOT USE THE HDMI AS I TRIED THE A TYPE AND THE MICRO TYPE PLEASE GIVE ME THE DETAILS
can anybody had played gta vicecity on this tab if played then tell me the steps plz help.............
First impression very good, used 24hrs delivery option cool service well you have play extra for that. Have install basic apps for gaming and its very responsive and easy to use. I got this for my kid to play games only, even sometimes I too get my hands dirty on this tab with him. It fulfils my requirement and am very happy. Thanks FlipKart.
Lava eTAB is super tablet in this price range. Played temple run, fruit ninza, 3d motorace game without lag. Only Bluetooth is missing and USB charging is missing.
this is a good product and packing was good flipkart always rocks dual core procesor and battery back up was good
Excellent tab for low budget.Using it since three months without any problem.Good sound quality.Played temple run,subway surfer ect. without any lag.Recommended for those who have low budget but want to own a tablet for daily use.
Everything Fine. Except Video Playback. I think VPU(video processing Unit) is not up to my expectation.
I recently brought this tablet from flipkart for Rs. 6000 approx. Delivery from flipkart, as always, was great. Display and performance is as per the specifications, which is great. Thought the tablet does not come with pre-installed pdf and docx reader/editor, installing these softwares is simple and easy. Just download and install. The only downside is that the audio output from the build-in speaker is very low. External speaker or earphone is a must. Overall, this one is a very good tablet in this price range. I give it 4 out of 5.
Delivery and packaging was good.good user experience,mostly u gotta download apps,plays most games smoother, 512 mb internal memory and rest is nand flash.camera is good in daylight.stock is good,if u looking for nice first hand android experience go for it.
Display-Okay,saturation is less,viewing angles are bad.your eyes can strain in few minutes camera-useless It can play 1080p videos with ease. strucks in between usage we have to leave aside for few minutes.so it come to alive.
with a price of 5500 this tab was a great choice in that budget because anything which was near that cpu and gpu config was the google nexus which was around 9k when i bought this Pros : cpu gpu and ram these 3 wont disappoint you at all cons :no usb charging , a little low battery backup which can be fixed after rooting because i found that wifi_suppliant_scan_interval in the build prop of this device was rediculously low 20 which when changed to 180 gave a much longer battery life not much development going on this device so you wont find custom roms for this device however you can try other rk3066 roms they might work regarding rooting this device you can root it via one click methods now
pls etrust me give the tablet thts a pure gaming tablet nenamark game give 83.2 fps thts no false its truuuuu trust me plse plse buy the tablet
1.Tablet Looks sturdy and weighs heavy. 2.A good tab for gaming.OTG works fine. 3.Takes too much time for charging.Display is only moderate. Overall its a budget tablet for those who have only a few bucks!!!!(Opt for Nexus7)
1. Fast delivery as usual by Flipkart. 2. Good packing... 3. Tablet working fine, still no issue... 4. Better look and feel
first lets talk about cons cons - no Bluetooth - requires more time to charge the battery - sound is low [ but its good when u insert headphone ] pros - 1 GB ram. runs very fast - 1.5 GHz dual core - built quality is superb - great looks - benchmarks are good - good for gaming - 4.2 jelly bean - touch is very responsive - no lags cons which wont affect that much - battery life is not that great but with few tricks you can save it [ switching off when not in us , use aeroplane mode when internet is not in use ] - display is average. but when you remove the screen guard it will look better and touch response will be more great -- only few dongles can be connected [ i made a mistake by purchasing wrong dongle. plz check the list of recommended dongles ]
Hi i am writing this review to tell about the product xtron. I bought this around 6 months ago but after two months the battery started acting crazy. Now the battery is almost dead. It charges fully but after start using, it suddenly jumps to 100 to 71% and after few minutes it jumps to 41 and to 30.finally it shuts down automatically. It hardly works for 1 hour. Is there a way to fix this. I am not sure. If any one know service center please help. My advice better go for a well branded products.
pros: tablet is good. feels sturdy. good storage space.and better battery backup for a budget tablet. cons: weak wifi. No drivers available for usb debugging.
VERY GOOD PRODUCT, VERY FAST SERVICE FROM FLIP CART EVEN REPLACEMENT REACHES ME VERY NEXT DAY WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION. ONE MINUS IS NOT BLUETOOTH SUPPORT.
The Lava Etab Xtron+ is an above average tablet for its price. At a price of Rs. 5980, it offers an excellent package with decent hardware, compact form factor and the latest version of Android Jelly Bean. It's interesting to look at if you're looking for a device for browsing the Web or playing casual games and are on a budget.
I purchased this TAB @6999 last week from Flipkart, it is an awesome TAB @this price from Flipkart 5999, the deal is awesome!! Just go for it....
Its pathetic tablet and total headache. Firstly the screen in unusable you have to hold it direcly in front of your face otherwise you cannot see a thing. Forget of keeping it on a table and using it. And the charger is such that you will have to go to mars to find a replacement. Its unique proprietary that you cannot even find it in a mobile shop. And the length of wire is such that you cannot use it while it is plugged in. And the irony is such that without plugging in you cannot use it, the battery life is pathetic. Sold it in rs.2000 with broken charger pin in tablet. Keep away. period.
None of the negative remarks by the purchasers were found to be true. The product was perfect and has no scratch. The only problem is to load big games in additional cards as the default in the OS is to load everything in the tablet memory which gets full. Otherwise perfect and is equivalent to a desktop of 2003-2004 models.
I bought the tab a month back....N it is quite awesome.. No issues n slow downs...... Runs very smooth even with the HD games...like MC4... plays in HD format.. N above all the battery life is very impressive... This tab won't let ur expectations down.
have been using for the past 2 weeks, awsome product ! very satisfied. it's a great deal. pros gps 1.5 ghz clock speed ideal for multi tasking hd resolution quick charging very high sound cons it's about the unlock screen- unlike jelly bean 4.1.1 there is no option for opening a specific app *if you are searching a tab for gaming and movie watching buy it
hello guys i have a question.i know battery of this tab is poor but if i keep it charging* then can i keep playing 24/7. i mean if i keep charging it for 10 hours then can i play massive games for 10 hours? or it will keep getting low and die please answer fast
IT HAS NOTHING EXCEPT PURE PERFORMANCE !!! IT CAN RUN ANY GAME U THROW AT IT CAMERA IS NOT TOO GOOD BUT DEFINITELY OK CAN PLAY 1080P VIDEOS ITS BATTERY LIFE IS DECENT SOME GAMES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE FIFA 14 SHADOWGUN DEATH TRIGGER MODERN COMBAT ZERO HOUR DARK KNIGHT RISES ETC........... MORE THAN A TABLET U CAN CALL IT AS A GAMING BEAST
I picked this Tab after reading mostly positive reviews on Flipkart. And I was NOT disappointed. It functions without any lag or stutter. Screen resolution is amazing was able to read an ebook without magnifying the font. Once I switched on Flight mode battery lasted even longer. Its an amazing TAB at a sub 7K price point. Only complaint is the lack of a universal charger port thru micro-USB which rules out charging by portable power banks. Would happily give 4 stars.
The tab works great performance wise and powered by 1.5ghz processer and 1 gb ram its very fast and works really well.....but there are other areas where it scores really low. The screen is very reflective due to which if there is any amount of light in the vicinity watching videos is really tough.....above that viewing angles are very limited....person sitting nearby finds it difficult to get a proper view.....there is no scratchguard available for this model (the screen is very prone to scratches).....as the size is non standard....same applies to cases....there is no case that accommodates this tab..... Performance wise the tab wont disappoint you, also the build quality of the tab is excellent...i have already dropped it thrice....
received the tab after 3days of order, i mostly use it for browsing , youtube, and reading books with my mobile wifi hotspot using 3g network, movies plays just flawless and played temple run which was smooth but lagged at certain times, i have used it for 2 months and was pretty satisfied with its performance considering its price, only downside the battery last for around 2and half hr to 3 hr only, i m a average user, not expecting latest android upgrade, its the right tab to have with this price tag, it just serve the purpose i bought it for....
Best tab still ever ,, Nice for surfing net, and wonderful 4 PLAYING GAMES !!!! U cn play whatever u want ,it has 1.5 ghz processor which nicely runs any of games in android plat form ,u just have to download it,, Though it does not support any sim but its wifi network is very smooth through which a user can access internet very well !!!!!
Friends l have purchased Lava Etab few months back(not this model). When I have problem with on/off button, I have visited one of there Service Center located in Bhimavaram. Even after 5 months, they couldnot repair the product saying that they have sent to company for repair. When I contacted at email to care@lavainternational.in . There is no reply from them. I advice you friends dont buy Lava products. Though they are good products, but no proper after sales support.
i bought this product 3 days ago i really happy with this tab 1.gaming is really awesome you can play heavy games like nova 3 nfs most wanted etc 2.it is powered by 1.5 ghz dual core cpu and mali 400 quadcore gpu it is very good for multitasking my advice:-if you spend lots of time in gaming on this device it is a must have device
LAVA etab XTRON+ review after 1 day use PRO : 1. GPU is too damn good plays high end games like GTA, Real Soccer with good graphics and no lags absolutely. Remember to take the full benefit of the Mali400 quad core GPU by changing the display settings and turning off the frame limiter to get better performance. 2. Viewing angle is not horrible from sides but kinda negative ish from the up and down 3. OTG cable allows wireless mouse key boards 4. Wi Fi reception is standard 5. Standard tab body built CONS: 1. Charger type is a dedicated non usb charger and cannot charge though the micro usb slot so problem is you cant use any power bank to charge this tab on the go however a converter would do the trick but still need to search for such a converter first! 2. OTG cable could not connect to my Segate 500GB HDD tried with Pro version of Nexus Media Importer (Yes i bought it just to try and failed). Still need to check if few pen drives might work or not. 3. Pre packed cable qualities are pathetic and fails expectations by all means. 4. Audio jack 3.5mm is on the top of the tab which makes it little annoying to watch videos or play games at time (few games wont allow the free rotation of screen in that case you are stuck with a wire to manage between you and your tab screen) 5. Heavy to hold 6. Glossy scratch guard of poorest quality, change it 7. Memory card is half blocked by some internal apps or something i dont care what it is, unless you root it consider this tab as 512 MB, major dissapointment for me. 8. 8GB i could find close to 6GB only dont know why In a word if sole intention is to play high end games, watch movies smoothly go for it eyeshut but if you expect quality and value adds that you are habituated with HTC/Samsung brands then might dissapoint you not for its hardware/software performance but for its design and accesories built quality. In the end its LAVA not some tab or mobile giant but still manages to compete and win over many tabs under 15000 rs.
was awesome for one month! then became disaster, straight white line started occurring! contacted the service center on 22 July 2013 now its been more than one and a half month! no tablet nothing, no response!! don't go for it!!
I bought this tab from flipkart only at a price of 6700 which was a great deal and i simply stole it. Now let's come to Review of the Tab First thing that you notice about this tab out of the box is simply how buttery smooth and responsive and felixble it is. It gives you a basic idea of what android is actually and how it operates. I have never seen a lag in this tab so far, but the most interesting part is that, my friend has Samsung Galaxy Tab2 with calling feature and his tab's transition and animations aren't that fluid and smooth like mine, in simple word his tab gives a sense of restriction and lag. The reason why i'm talking about my experience rather than stating specs like ners is because people buy product to have a good experience with it. SO FAR MY EXPERIENCE WAS FLAWLESS. Many people complains about battery life and screen resolution... 1>Screen resolution made me more than happy as i switched from a Micromax funbook pro experience(total crap, ever worse than crap) 2>Battery do drain faster and takes long time to charge. But you can easily perform you basic task through out the day as the tab comes preloaded with netquin battery saver. Second thing tab supports 3D parallax live wall paper which is live wallpaper shown in iOS7 keynote, 3rd Tab supports multi window multitasking like note devices of samsung and also comes with wifi direct feature out of the box. I would say if you came to this page and went away and chose a different tab to buy, i would say that you were the most unluckiest person i've ever seen. This is the only Indian product that made my samsung fan boy friend jelous. But there's only one thing that i miss the most in this tab is lack of bluetooth but i don't care much about it as i got wifi direct works flawlessly with samsung divices. Tab's speakers are weak, but the headphone that comes in box is pretty darn good. (User of apple iPod,JBL headphone,HTC with beats). So i know what i'm talking about. The tab feels very premium as the back is made of aluminium. I became a fan boy of LAVA. for me i was lucky, if u had any problem with flipkart delivery, and you gave negative review about this product, that would only make you look like a jackass. I'm prepping to make Video review of this bad boy. Happy tabbing for those who bought it already and knows what i'm talking about. Honestly the maximum magic is done by giving jelly bean 4.2.2 out of the box. Thanx LAVA And for those who are complaining about only 500mb of app space in internal storage, they really need to learn some thing. That 500MB is for preloaded apps that comes on board, other apps that are downloaded that can only be installed in internal storage get's installed in a free space of 5gigs space left untouched for you, and more over you can pop in a 8gig micro SD card and install apps there. The app switching animation is like iPhone'sd app switching transitions. In shot a premium product served at low price. I say grab the deal before it's price increase even more.
Its a good gaming tablet. we can play any type of games. it plays almost all HD videos in youtube. i had problem in playing 1280*720 quality videos. Battery back up is normal. it gives 3 hrs max. we can play temple run continuously for 2 hrs max. it detects and connect to Wi-fi within 10 feet.(without any obstacle) i have turned off all the auto sync and auto update. uninstalled all unwanted Apps. i can see the battery charing time is less now. within an hour, it charges from 10 to 100%
I recently purchased this device from flipkart. 1st thing to mention is the service. Prompt delivery. Excellent package. Thanks to flipkart. About the tab, its the best device in market in this price range. Has got good display. Easy to use.(though lil hard to hold coz of sharp edges). Battery backup is again great. I could Continuously watch 2 movies and then about 30 to 40 minutes of browsing. Overall the device hardware specs are really nice. One negative point that I noticed is its speaker. Terribly bad. No sound at all. So had to use headset always. 4 stars cuz of speaker quality. Or else this device deserves 5+ rating.:-)
After having used this tablet for 2 months below is my experience. Pros : Good processor and RAM. You can install and use almost any app on the app store. Build quality superb. Cons : Normal battery life. You have to keep it on Air Plane mode to save the battery as it gets discharge pretty fast. Otherwise as well complete battery gets discharge after 2-3 hours of usage. Weight: its a big issue with this tablet. Though the hardware quality is best at this price but it weighs quite a lot and palms starts paining after sometime. WIFI : Tablet does not catches wifi signals even at short distances like 10-15 meters and you dont have the option of using 3g dongle as well. So in way this device is of no use once you are outside that periphery of wifi. Sound quality : worst. you have to stick your ears to the speakers to hear it though works fine with earphones. All in all I suggest dont go with this product unless you want to spend 6K something on a device which has limited utility like playing games and using apps.
Thanks flipkart for ur customer friendly service. Lava is one of fast immerging desi mobile brand.In this lava xtron+ tablet . pro display is clear, good for gaming, 3.30hr bettary life normally,it supports almost all kind of 3g dongles con no bluetooth ,low volume,takes 4-5hr for charging.
you can buy this tablet if you like high end gaming ( games of 500 mb to 2-3 GB) to browse internet ( u must have a WiFi connection or any android mobile remember u can create a WiFi hotspot by any android mobile and utilise its WiFi on any other device ) to watch movies from yr hard drive ..... ( hard drive will not be played when u r charging yr tablet because charger is not good and Chagres tablet in more time....... if u have a Nokia mobile. or a large charger of any mobile ... by using a multi pin ( available at 40-50 rs ) u can have fun watching movie by yr hard. drive other wise copy and paste movies in yr SD card from hard drive if u have a wired broadband ....u can connect yr tablet with it by using Ethernet ..... ( u can make yr own Ethernet wire connector u will require a old USB mouse .... cut one end of USB there will be four wires ..... now u have 24 different choices to insert that wire in yr lan jack) my language can only be understood by a engineer .... :-( no problem search Google " how to use Ethernet on android tablet ) display is IPS though they haven't mention it all together a very good tablet ...... but u should have knowledge how to utilised a android otherwise buy a tablet with 3g sim
CONS: - Only about 500 Mb internal primary memory, so you cannot install a lot of apps. - Weak Wifi Reciever, disconnects frequently - No 5Ghz Wifi band - No Bluetooth - Few pixels are damaged, noticable when you look carefully - Charging adapter has very small cable length - Rather heavy PROS: - Price - Great gaming machine, good in bechmarks
Does it play HD & Blue Ray format movies? Please reply anyone who is using this Tab. Thanks in advance. If yes, then I would love to buy Lava E-Tab XTRON+ Tablet. I have also seen the review of Lava E-Tab XTRON+ Tablet on Tech Guru and even they have rated the product as 4 out of 5.
hi guys i have just got this tab 2day.... flipkart rox gave me in 2 days :D love me flipkart... awesome gaming table for this price i also have galaxy tab 3... but this tab is better( only for gaming) runs hd games like nova 3,gta vice city without lag.. will soon make a hd game video in youtube and it plays 1080p without any lag...
This is the best tablet you con buy in this price range Pros: Fast processor - clocked at 1.6 GHz Great build quality Cheap for the specs offered Can play most HD games with ease like dead trigger,shadowgun ,iron man,NFS most wanted Responsive screen Great battery backup 8 GB storage expendable to 32gb 5 point touch screen 1 GB ram - won't get in many tabs at this price Higher benchmark than nexus 7 ,Samsung galaxy tab 2 Internet support through WiFi and dongle Cons: Bad screen guard provided Dead pixels - I bought this tab but was disappointed by a dead pixel in the screen I got the tab replaced for a new one No Bluetooth Not so great viewing angles Bad camera - seriously its like a camera on a Chinese phone Make sure you buy a separate screen guard Can't watch YouTube in full screen in chrome Speaker not very loud Not many service centres Cannot root No USB chord provided to connect to pc Old dongles are not supported
I bought this tablet for the sole purpose of reading and must say it hasn't disappointed me. Display isn't superb but then expecting Retina display for this price would be unfair. Nice tablet overall.
Overall the product is good. But the LAva company is mis-selling the product by writing in the description that it has USB cable. When I opened the box, in that USB cable was missing. Sound volume is a bit low
I bought this tab yesterday and is very happy for my decision to buy this.in 7k what would you expect in such a low price? I got this in just 2 days.thanks to flipkart for such a fast service. Its look is great and viewing angles are also not so bad. In my opinion anyone can buy this product..I bought this in 6561.
XTRON + was not upto expectations. Some of the limitations that I am facing after using for couple of weeks 1) Wi-Fi reception quite poor (I have to be in the room to play anything on web) 2) Audio - Speakers are not great for doing SKYPE or for playing music. 3) The charging cable is too short. Falls below expectations. Not Sure if there are other better tabs in this price range but maybe better to invest more & go for a superior Samsung galaxy.
replaced t tablet twice but no use.................still it is crap batter back up poor performance is superb................no Bluetooth worth of buying if u r lucky................................................................
First of all i have purchased this from flipkart and first i will tell the pros: Any android game from hd to normal runs butterly smooth /it plays hd video without any lag/quad core gpu and dual core tablet which is unique in this price/5.8gb internal memory for file storage and 506 mb for apps/the build quality is awesome looks like ipad and now the Cons: charging time is nearly 4 hrs and the battery backup on moderate usage is max. 3 and half hours/ the viewing angles are pathetic and the screen is reflective and can be used like a mirror/ at top and at the right side there are two orange dots appearing from the time of delivery and my friend has the same dots promblem/ the speaker are not audible at all it is very low /the charger cord is very small and pathetic earphones. If u r looking a tablet for entertaiment purposes it is good. But still i would not recommend it to anyone
what battery does it have li-ion battery li-polymer battery and is the battery backup good..I wanted to purchase this product but was a little concerned abt the battery..everywhere it is mentioned that it has 3700mAh battery..but nowhere specified what type of battery...please help me out with this!!
LAVA xtron+ very professionally built tablet with all great and latest features. have been using it from last 30 days, no issues at all. rocking performance. great touch sensitivity, good battery life, specially the display is mind blowing, and it has so many good features which you wont get in even range tablets.... Guys just ignore all armature reviews, at this price LAVA xtron+ is the king in the current Indian market i can say. just go for it blindly.
I got the first piece as a defective piece, then I returned to Flipkart. After returning I got replacement after 15Days. Again I got the box with two seals. in that one seal is already opened. it is not a fresh piece what I received. It is a repaired item and the screen is flickering slightly always. Now I come to the product, CONS: 1. WI FI connectivity range is only 5 feet. very very poor wifi range, 2. external speaker sound output is very very very less. it is designed for the people who are all having cat ears, 3.Service centres: There is no service centres for LAVA. All are collection centres. Once you give it repair means you have to wait minimum 15days to 01 month. 4. Charging time 5. Youtube playback PROS: 1.Design, 2.Touch sensitivity, 3. Gaming including high end games (no lagging at all) 4. Display (only straight angle) Conclusion: Spend another two thousand rupees for Samsung tab 3110 to get better tab and very good after sales support. Please don't buy this
this is very good tablet..value for money....internaml memory is 8 gb that is great..this tablet can connect even with your external hard drive..just plug and play..i have 2 tb hard drive and it play every thing very smoothly...some say this can't play you tue videos..but it play all videos through google crome... bluetooth is not in this tablet that is littel disappointing.. i want to know just one thing that i want to buy case cover for this tablet .please suggest if any one know...
Lava Xtron + boasts of 1.5 GH dual core processor with 1 GB of ram. That's it. It does not have any thing else. If you are thinking that a good processing speed and ram are sufficient to make a tablet best buy then you are probably wrong. What Xtron + lacks most is the good build quality for all of its accessories and the tablet itself. Few of the things I found unbearable in Xtron + are: 1. The 504 MB of internal storage for applications or games. Th rest 5.83 GB of Nand Flash storage can not be used for applications. It is can be used only for storing media files. I being an avid gamer found this 504MB space to less to install anything. Even Micromax and other tablets of same price range who quote 8 GB of internal space offer much more actual internal storage then this one. 2. The worst quality camera I have ever seen. It is better to have no camera than to have those. 3. The charger is a DC pin charger with L shaped plug (which is outdated) and the charging cord length is too short to use. That means you have to carry your charger every where you go and is quite irritating because of its short length. Also the tablet does not support charging through mini USB. 4. The aluminum body on Xtron + looks good in photo but not in real. It is slippery and because of sharp edges, you can not hold it for half an hour also. I found it most uncomfortable tablet to hold. The screen quality, battery capacity, speaker quality, WIFI connectivity, video rendering etc are all average and as expected from a tablet of this range. I did not find these either appealing or bad because you can not expect more than that in the given price range. But I feel my points 1 to 4 are worth expecting if I buy a 7 inch tablet for 7K.
Purchased this tab on the 17 of June was delivered on 19 of June with scratches on the screen was replaced on 24 June but with the same story scratched screen but less scratches and and tablet battery which would not charge i could make out whether it was a Charger fault also so now this also is taken back and an amt Rs. 6640 is been credited to my wallet very disappointed with the whole episode but I was happy with the quick response of flipkart there should be checks and balances with products they market that a replacement should be a 100% original genuine box packed new product not a resealed second hand product which was the same both times.
If not for the Wifi range which is only about10-15ft right next to the router this product would be really good value. However the 2nd unit also has the same range as the first one. My phone/laptop and likewise my wife's equipment also work properly in the same range. The signal is sometimes upto full strength but the device drops packets like crazy (that's technical speak to say there is no continuous connection from the device to the wifi router). So web pages, audio/video does not load up properly. A shame though as otherwise it's a decent device for the money. Of course, I have to say my Nokia Lumia 800 is much more responsive and slick compared to the tablet. It's a pity though that there are no reasonably priced Windows or IOS competitors for this. Certainly the I-Pad mini is a lot more responsive than this device. Battery life is as advertised and recharging is rather slow. On the plus side, it detected my Vodafone USB data stick and dialled out with zero configuration! If you are going to use this in the same room as the router or with a data card it's probably ok but otherwise you're better of with a device that has better range. Lava support page - did not quite work, so I could not ask them about any known issues and workaround for the Wifi range. Full marks to flipkart for providing me with a replacement for the first device (2nd one has an open ticket now that it has the same problems - but I'm sure they will resolve anything that is in their control). Will update if it turns out that I had 2 dud products as far as range goes.
I have purchased this Tablet from other website, but now I regret. Don't just look at its specifications, It is worst Tablet for its proce. 1. Internal Storage is Just 504MB + 5.83GB Nand Flash and not 8 GB for root apps you will get only 504MB 2. Display quality is not as good as mentioned by its Pixel. 3. Cameras worst quality. 4. WiFi will never connect for more then couple of minutes accept if you are with in 7 feet range of your WiFi modem and it takes ages to reconnect. Sometimes you need to switch your wifi several times. 5. Every Tablet comes with lots of scratches in the front screen and on the back Camera Panel (you can read reviews of other too). It looks like Lava is selling all rejected tablets(b grade defective tablets) in India and believes that All Indians are bull S**ts. 6. Battery backup is also poor and it takes more then 5 hours to recharge it and also it can't be charged via USB. 7. Speakers are worst, you can't hear even at full volume. I think it is built for those who have Dog's ear. 8. It is a non-popular and non-standard tablet. You can't find accessories specific for this tablet, net even Case cover. I suggest you instead of buying this tablet you should never buy any tablet and keep you money in your pocket. Much better you may go for Samsung Tab 2 P3110 WiFi only model by spending 1.5K more.
I purchased Lava E tab XTRON Tablet about two months back from Flipcart. Initially Tabelt worked well but after two months , it started giving probelm at the time of charging and does not charge . I got it reapired from Lava service centre but even after 2 days it satrted again the same probelm . Felt that hardware used in these tablets are not of good quality . Also service network is not so good
This is an amazing tablet, Loved it. It has been a couple of days and I had found some good points and bad points about it. I bought it in a deal of 10% extra off from flipkart ( I got lucky there with 6290Rs). Anyways didnt had a USB cable but it specifies on the box about it. I got an OTG usb cable though, I guess some arent getting that. Yeah I too got the screen scratched but it was a screen guard cover, removed it and found another screen guard which is less scratch prone and gives better touch responsiveness. It is nice to have the back panel made from full UNI-BODY ALUMINIUM but it might give you electric shocks when connected via charger or HDMI but the shocks arent that intensity and can be handled but feels irritating. HDMI works great with full 1080p and playing full HD games with quad core Mali 400 it makes an experience. One more thing you need to keep it near the wifi router or else it wont work. So I will recommend this ignoring the downsides because of the price tag it comes with. Points: Looks:- 5/5 User interference:- 5/5 Software:- 3/5 ( comes with no good preloaded apps and no gesture keyboard) Display:- 4/5(Viewing angles are bad) Sound:- 2/5 ( speakers are worthless but headphones sound awesome) Performance:- 5/5( getting an Antutu score around 11000 is just great [note: samsung ............................galaxy S2 has 9890 and galaxy tab 311 has 10500max) Battery:- 5/5( pretty descent for a 7k tablet gives 20 hrs of standby or 5hrs of 720p movies ....................or 3hrs of HD gaming [ Real Racing 2] Average score 4/5 So will definitely recommend this!
I puchased a Lava E-tab Xtron from Flipkart in April 2013. No issues with Flipkart delivery. I have been facing issues with the product since the last 2~3 weeks. The screen freezes and stops responding. After pressing the power button for more than 10 seconds the tablet shuts down, but doesnt restart immediately. Restart is possible only after a gap of more than 5 mins. I submitted the tablet with the local service center. They were confident that a s/w reload will help. Not sure what it meant as I observed that all my data remained as is inspite of the s/w reload!! The problem wasnt resolved and now it was so bad that I couldnt use the tablet for more than 2 minutes before it froze. Then I tried reaching the Lava customer service center. No toll free number available and hence making a STD call is the only option. Multiple calls to get through to an agent, only to be told that the service center I had visited is not in their database!! After making all the STD calls over 2 days, I managed to get the contact number of the area service manager and got in touch with him. His remedy was to submit the tablet at another service center, which I will do over the coming weekend. But the message here is that if this product works, consider yourself lucky...Else you are the mercy of no one!! No matter how good a porduct you have, if the after sales service sucks....you are doomed!!
got this tab from flipkart one and half months back.....the battery is not charging..get discharged in half an hour even if kept in standby mode...what u going to do with good features when you cant use it on the go....it has the battery issue in every review i have seen...you would expect the company to have rectified it...just shows quality consciousness of the company
Its an awesome tablet....buy it without any thought.I haven't seen any problems while YouTube streaming, and the battery drains in an standard rate. You will get everything and best in this price range, I HAVE BOUGHT THIS TAB SPECIALLY FOR GAMING PURPOSE,SO BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY HIGH DEFINATION GAMES LIKE VICE CITY, IRON MAN, ASPHALT, ETC....... it has no Bluetooth so sharing files becomes difficult.
I have been using this product since the last 2 weeks. The tab is a bit on the heavier side but the finish is on the better side. Nice to hold in both hands. One handed use is not too bad either. The OS is JellyBean - 4.2.2 with no customisations to the UI. Infact the stock UI helps preserving RAM for intensive tasks. Performance of the tab is very good. It is quite fast and gets the job done. Youtube app is working fine for me as well as playing videos with subtitles. Games that I installed are Angry Birds Star Wars HD, Cut the Rope:Time Travel HD, Temple Run 2, Ninjump Deluxe, Mutant Roadkill, Subway Surfers, Doodle Jump and they ran without a hitch. Graphic intensive that I installed were - NFS Most Wanted, Real racing 3 and Frontline Commando:D-Day. The graphics performance was good and satisfactory. WIFI has a lesser range than my smartphone but its not a problem. Didnt get to test dongle functionality as I dont have one right now. Have tried the OTG cable to plug in m Pen-Drive and External hard disk and they work perfectly. But mind you they drain a lot of battery. HDMI works good too and I have tested it on my Sony Bravia LED TV. But the product came with scratches on the screenguard and the USB cable was missing. However that is the fault of the seller and it has nothing to do with the performance of the product. All in all a product worthy of spending 7K if you are new to android and want to start safe with a tab. Also a good option for people already with a smartphone who want to buy a tab for casual use like playing games... I am happy with the product as it performs as expected and I would to recommend it to others..
Just needs to include calling facility and this tab will definitely turn into a master piece of its segment not just in terms of sails but also in terms of enhancing the brand value, that's a challenge!!!!! Plz look into this seriously!!!!!!!!
I recieved the Tablet , yesterday , overall look and feel is good , i am yet to experience all the features and give my review. However i need help on 2 things , what App i need to play youtube video , as eventhough i downloaded app , Video does not play , rest of the page loads perfectly fine . Which Dongle works with this TAB , i have reliance broadband dongle , ZTE.
Using this tab for a week.advantage s:-nice display, good touch response but not as good as HTC wildfire s and one v,good built design and quality, quite fast,good battery backup. Disadvantages:- user interface is not that good compared to HTC and micromax,GPU good on specs but unable to render smooth gameplay,colours are a bit washed off,pretty bad sound by loudspeaker, WiFi turns off on its own on sleep,a bit heavy. About flipkart:- good delivery ,data cable is missing from t box,tablet had a lot of scratches on t front and on t back camera panel,front scratches can b removed by getting off the scratch guard. About lava etab xtron+:- only comes with default android apps like play store,gmailetc and Google chrome no YouTube or fb. 500 mb for apps installation,5.78gb for game data and other files.1000mb ram is available of which 540mb ram is free 4 user Gaming :installed angry birds space,front line camando ,lane splitter ,temple run oz, subway surf,t20 cricket fever,pro evolution soccer 12 Angry birds,Temple run and subway surf runs smoothly.front line commando hangs after a gameplay of 20minutes,t20 hangs abruptly at any time,pes12 takes about 8minutes to load,lane splitter runs smoothly but sometimes gyro sensor works abruptly. Nova 3,modern combat 4 are not supported hence unable 2 install. YouTube works fine. Tab support adobe flash player 11.1 in browser. Strongly recommend others:- go for this tab if u are first 2 android and wants tab for only reading. Otherwise go for Samsung galaxy tab 2 p3100 or Google nexus 7 as the provide better service than lava.
I got this tablet and it exceeded all my expectations. For people who dont know Nenamark2 is a benchmark test to test GPU performance i.e how the tablet performs in real world Gaming. Samsung Galaxy S4 scores 60 FPS,Galaxy TAB 2 scores 36 FPS, Nexus 7 scores 56 FPS and this BEAST scored 64 FPS QUADRANT Benchmark was GREATER than Nexus 7 as well. No Lags at all amazing look ( aluminium on back ) looks Great and POSH in hands. Resolved Concs. - Some of the users say product came with lots of scratches : Yep its true it has a little scratches on it BUT the scratch is NOT ON THE TABLET its on the pre Coated SCREEN GUARD not on the TABLET. You can remove screen guard and can put a new one if you want. - Youtube issues :- Well I don't know maybe Lava has resolved it because mine it did not came with any youtube app. I downloaded it from App store and it worked. For those who say its not working try updating your tablet or go to a LAVA service center. - Display :- Its great if you hold it correctly AMAZING DISPLAY ( 10/10 ), If you tilt a little you wont feel any difference its amazing thanks to IPS. But if you completely tilt it Display goes a little bad ( 7.5/10 ) but considering the price 10/10. Concs :- - Speaker Quality is very poor although you can use earphones/headphones to enhance Volume and BEATS. - No Bluetooth - No Sim ( But supports 3G via dongle you can connect it through OTG cable came as in box accessories ) - Bad Camera but its OK ( Does The Job ) OK now the most important part people are complaining about its Battery Life... I too had it but I rectified the problem and solved it. You need to turn ON the airplane mode, by default its off and in status it always say searching for signals ( Sim Signals ) No Signals Found and in Battery status it says that it consumes about 60% of battery as it does not have any sim and it keeps on FORCING it to search for signals consumes a lot of battery. Solution :- Turn on airplane mode ( it blocks sim ) not only Battery will Double up but also Charging time will be about a LOtttt Faster than before. You can do it by pushing the drop down menu and hit airplane symbol so simple as that :) Pros - Excellent Hardware,No Lags, ULTRA GAMER TAB, Build Quality is GREAT probably the best 7 inch tab Built Quality I have seen till now and rest all for what a TAB should be. I AM GOING TO ORDER 1 MORE RIGHT NOW
I recently bought Lava Etab Xtron+ but had a dead pixel and scratches. I received the replacement Tab immediately from FLIPKART. GREAAAAAT Service. FLIPKART ROCKS. As far as tablet is concerned go buy it without thinking twice. Runs games as smooth as butter. You get latest android jelly bean 4.2.2, 1 GB RAM quadcore gpu what more can you ask for. NO sim support but who cares.Seriously are you gonna make that phone call with a tablet? I dont think so. Go get it. But only from FLIPKART. Otherwise you might regret it later if you buy from somewhere else.
FlipKart is the best online store available and i can say proudly that I’m their customer for a long long time now. The product delivery was just spot on and the customer service, the best in the world. They are the best people I’ve ever come across. Long live FlipKart :) This is a solid product (spec wise) no doubt, but then i had to return it nonetheless, why? read on. pros: 1. Neat design, robust build 2. Best specs you can get for the price 3. Good battery backup cons: 1. Horrible testing, highly unreliable (1st unit had restart problems, 2nd unit had electrical problems, at last i had to return the product) 2. bad screen quality 3. Charging takes forever comments: If you think you can live with the problems and not use this tablet while its charging or you wouldn't mind replacing the item many times then i think its worth it. I've come to understand that LAVA does not even bother about customer satisfaction or proper product testing and i really regret that FlipKart has to deal with the problems caused by the product. So buy with caution or even better, just dont buy.
Observations 1. Youtube working 2. Reliance Netconnect 3G Dongle working (you have to set up APN and all) Pros 1. Great finish 2. Fast CPU and GPU (games are smooth) 3. Alright battery backup Cons 1. USB cable mising 2. Scratches on screen guard
I visited LAVA service center with XTRON+ and had a discussion with Service center staff. YouTube issue: They have an upgraded version of software which they flashed on my XTRON+. Now the XTRON+ is playing YouTube in Android and through YouTube App just fine. Scratch Issue: They informed me that there are more than one layer of screen guards on XTRON+ and scratches are on the uppermost layer and I can remove this layer. As a result my TAB was looking brand new
I had purchased this tab particularly for using my internet with my tata docomo dongle...but this Tab is just a big crap...it turned out to be useless for me...i am unable to use dongle and only way to access internet is through Wifi.. i would advice guys that not get pleased with the configurations that this tab provides... go for tabs that supports 3g dongles though having little lower configurations then this...
I ordered the product at 16th June and received at 19th, one day before flipkart promised. About flipkart Delivery n packing was nice. But I noticed two seal out of the box, one was tempered (broken), other one was added over it making the sense that box was pre-opened. It was confirmed by two facts' first one the box was missing USB cable as mentioned outside the box and second one is, the tab didn't ask me to configure my Google account when I first time switch it on. There was tiny scratch in back camera panel. But screen was clean, my luck. I am really disappointed by such activity from my fav online site flipkart, sad. Now about the tablet Advantages 1. Very nicely built, it has a premium look n lava done a very good job. 2. Ultrafast processor with a very decent ram... 3. Installed 15 games' like blood n glory, D-day, MIB-3, temple run oz, temple run brave, subway surfer, jetpack joyride etc... Smooth gaming experience each time. 4. Less preinstalled apps. 5. Some reviewer complained about YouTube video streaming, but for me it was worked nicely. 6. About 5.5 GB internal storage, very nice. 7. Touch response of the screen is very nice. 8. A good quality screen guard was provided.. 9. Overall nice Battery backup. 10. I ran quadrant, antutu, vellamo etc benchmark tests, its performance was far better than well known branded tablets and phones. Disadvantages 1. Screen is a bit washed off. 2. Charger cable is very short, I don't know what's the logic behind this. 3. No USB data cable, although mentioned outside the box pack 4. SD card is remained protruded after insertion, sometime coming out upon unknowing pressure over it. 5. External speaker sound is very low.... But earphones provide decent doubt output. 6. Memory allocated for apps is about 500 mob, only about 350 mob was free.... Its really low... Can u increase it LAVA???? Overall I am very very impressed by LAVA's such an effort, premium look and top level performance together. And flipkart really you disappointed me, you can provide 400 rs gift coupon, but will think twice before my next purchase.....
hi frds i have a doubt. i bought lava e tab xtron + tablet but in this tab's front camera side touch is is not working.for example ( if i click that battery icon on this side. option are not open). but if i click the battery icon on the other side that option will open. pls anyone verify my doubt
I visited LAVA service center with XTRON+ Youtube Issue: YouTube issue. They have an upgraded version of software which they flashed on my XTRON+. Now the XTRON+ is playing YouTube in Android and through YouTube App just fine. Scratch Issue: They informed me that there are three layers of scratch guards on XTRON+ and scratches are on the uppermost layer and I can remove the this layer and still have two layers of scratch guards. Generally other tablet manufacturers remove the first/second layer of scratch guard and leave on the last layer and hence no scratches.
Hi Guys! I have a problem regarding the Lava E-Tab XTRON+ Tablet I just purchased from Flipcart that got delivered on 18th June. I am unable to use my mts dongle to connect to the internet. When inserting the dongle as I already knew before, the device will not detect the usb dongle so I went ahead to create a new APN. I am able to save a new APN by switching between the screens. I am able to save most of the fields except the "MCC" & "MNC" values. When I enter values for these the new APN I created and saved earlier disappears. I tried using the home button, application switcher, back button, menu button on the top that looks like 3 squares stacked. I spent a whole 2 days trying to get it to accept values for those fields. And I don't even know if my internet dongle will work. So can someone help me with this or has faced the same problem?? It seems to be a bug in Android 4.2.2 or in the tablet itself. If only Sandeep Kunder had posted his "Does not work on all Dongles" review earlier I would have had second thoughts buying this because my sole purpose of buying this was to use the internet on it. P.S. I am giving 3 stars only because I haven't yet used the tablet properly and I'm disappointed with it lack of connectivity with usb dongles.
Overall a good product as per specifications. However very important to note that the product does not recognize most dongles. Based on reviews here and other sites I purchased this product and bought a Tata Docomo 3G dongle (model MF190) but it did not recognize this model. This model of dongle i purchased after confirming with Lava customer care in Noida. But even after 10 days I am unable to sucessfully connect it. Lava service center in Pune now confirmed that this tablet was never made for dongles and is a Wi-Fi tablet only - this fact is very clear in the product manual as well. Totally unprofessional response from Lava customer care center. They are not taking any responsibility of this issue and for me its a loss - paid 2,500 for the new dongle. Tata Photon - EC156 / EC159 model connects without any issue. So to summarize, Super Product but please be careful of the dongles you use. Unable to give any more comments as i have not yet used the tablet due to above issue.
Strange but true, I ordered this just 2 days back. about average kind of product for its cost. first time when I used browser, youtube worked. after that it stopped totally. Also when I see in storage, it says internal 8 GB in specs, but while using it showed internal storage as total space - 504 mb, available 354 mb + nand flash total space 5.83 GB. Where is the total 8GB? And yes, the charging takes a lot of time, 4 hrs. Product deliverd with scratches. -- Just an update, I found that if you reboot, youtube starts working in browser, you may try, however thats a bug, you cant keep on rebooting everytime right?
i purchased the Xtron tablet After using it for a month period hardly 2 hrs / day found the tab hanging issue and not startup i given to local service center in chennai no support after 3 month of time no response from Lava Poor service & response before buy a unbranded items think about the service after sale
Ordered from flipkart , and got delivered with delay and with lot of scratches on screen look like used one. Feedback after 3 days of usage Pros's 1.Good performance for playing games and browsing, played top hd games smoothly 2. Good Battery backup (4-5 hours when browsing and played games) and good wifi reception 3. latest android os , dual core 1.5Ghz A9 processor with 1 GB DDR3 RAM Con's 1. Youtube videos not playing in browsers and in youtube app also 2.Charger length is short and usb charging not available 3. External Hdd are not supported only Pendrives are supported Good for Buying as you will get Good Performance Tablet in low price.
I have been buying products from flipkart for a long time now. Received the tab in 3 days time. Turnaround time is simply excellent. However upon receiving the product, i noticed that there were lot of scratches on the screen. Some are deep. Either the product was not handled properly during transit or the product was shipped like that by the seller. Either case it feels very sickening to have paid a lot for a product and getting the product which looks like its a used one. Pls include a survey to indicate the quality of product received and not just restricting to the service rendered by Flipkart. Service and Delivery 11 out of 10... 6 stars Quality of the product -1 out of 10..... -1 stars Mind you, when i talk about the quality of the product, i am referring to the physical appearance and not the tab's specs or quality of usage of the product. Will update the quality of usability and specs later. I have rated this product as 3 (Cumulative of excellent service and extremely bad quality product (physical appearance).
1)just realized the multiple user accounts feature is not available in this tab( feature exclusive for 4.2.2) it should be under the device section in settings app 2)even though gesture typing is enabled in the android(default) keyboard I'm not able to use it other than these anomalies the tab is super awesome!! some people have said that there is a problem with the youtube app but youtube app is working fine on my device just wanted to check whether there's a problem with my tab or with all others who have purchased... so please reply if u find these features working in your tabs
One week of experience after purchase, its great. Display viewing angles are not that much good like samsung, I bought this only for the HDMI port. The gyro sensor behaves abnormally sometimes during racing games, after all its CHINA !!!
very nice tab i bought through flip kart after several reviews. Xtron+ comes with 4.2.2 jelly bean OS. graphics are good. gaming is also good. Camera is ok kind. (2MP), i am not sure on the 0.3 MP front facing camera. HDMI port is also available but cable not included in the box. Other accessories are ok kind of quality especially the ear phones. It depends how to cost cut, perhaps Lava thinks accessories are not important! very low quality speakers but usable to some time. Since it has the standard jack may be one can opt for additional speakers. I was afraid to setup wifi at home and wifi can't be availed while we are in travel etc. But good news is it comes with OTG cable (on the go). I used my Tata photon + dongle it is recognised instantly. no configuration i made. so nice! It talks with service provider it seems, the settings have the monthly billing cycle and data limit automatically captured. It shows a warning line not to exceed the data limit etc. External speakers are now on the top side unlike xtron (on back). Quality is average, chalega!! This is my first review on a product. In my opinion the product for the price paid is very good! Any one with this tablet please let me know how to use the front facing camera.?
Looks good. Smooth browsing. Economical. I am not a fan of games. So, not tested on that front. Surprisingly videos are not playing, if any one knows how to fix please let others know who has this problem. Not sure if flipkart helps on this issue.
I bought this Tablet a week back from flipkart.com. Youtube is not at all working on this device. Tried it on both (Android and Google) browsers, tried by installing the youtube app, tried all suggestions found in Google, but no luck. I sent couple of queries to Lava support team, but no response. Finally, gave it in the service center. They are saying that all the Xtron+ devices have some issue playing youtube videos. Currently, they are waiting for a patch.
1.5Ghz with 1GB RAM, Android JellyBean (4.2.2) in this price. This product LAVA X TRON +, is a unique product with all features in this price under this 7" Tab category. It is worth purchasing. Also the performance is good.
Lava xtron+ is one of the best tablet in the market....its predecessor xtron was also a hit in India.All the draw backs of xtron except bluetooth connectivity was cleared in new upgrade xtron+ The main features of new upgrade which was not there in its predecessor are: 1)HDMI v1.4 2)Long lasting 3700mAh battery 3)2mp Back facing camera,0.3mp Front facing camera 3)no bluetooth If you are a game addict this one is for you graphic benchmarking it scored 58.6 fps "And This Tablet is 2 times powerful than samsung galaxy tab 2."
This is a good tab. I am using for few days now for entertainment cause of big screen like browsing,play game, see videos and listen music e.t.c.main is good battery backup compare Xtron,and about games like nov.gta,asphalt,modern warfare,ans touch is also very good. this is my exp. guys go with Xtron+ this good choice and value of money.
points 1.Nice Tab At Best in price. 2.Touch is good.Nice in speed with 8 G.B inbuilt memory. 3.Good For gaming and mailing purpose. WHEN COMPARE WITH SAMSUNG THIS IS NICE TAB AT THIS PRICE RANGE 6999. THERE IS DEMAND FOR THIS PRODUCT.NICE TAB WHEN COMPARED TO MICRO MAX .
u will find no trouble after buying this tablet accept bluetooth....... you can play any games in this with awesome experience........ ............................. ....... . ........................ ......................... ................... .................. .................................. ...............................
I don't have this tablet but i want to mention some difference between Xtron and Xtron+ OS : Lava E-Tab Xtron - 4.1.1 Lava E-Tab Xtron+ - 4.2.2 Camera : Lava E-Tab Xtron - 2mp Front . No back camera Lava E-Tab Xtron+ - 0.3mp Front . 2mp Back Battery : Lava E-Tab Xtron - 3500mAh Lava E-Tab Xtron+ - 3700mAh Price: Lava E-Tab Xtron - Rs.6499 Lava E-Tab Xtron+ - Rs.6999 Go for this , its very good tablet . I am planning to buy one but only thing i dislike about this tab is It does not have a Bluetooth . Still best in its price .
Very happy customer for Xtron, all things perfect except average battery only 3 hours in peak gaming, HDMI and 3G- this Xtron+ looks to improve on HDMI and battery. Wish they had a 3G version. Also, Lava/Flipkart- Can i upgrade my Xtron to 4.2.2 (Xtron+) Software somehow or get a replacement to Xtron+ :) Conclusion- Go for it eyes closed if 3G calling is not a bottleneck, this is a gem of a device at this price- simply amazing, even better now..
It is an upgrade to the lava etab xtron which i had purchased 2 months ago and have also order this piece of hardware.it has a greater battery, hdmi port,rear camera and the android 4.2.2 jellybean out of the box. now coming to your queries no it does not have bluetooth, you can connect 3g dongle to it and it works fine a otg cable comes in the box prepacked, yes it has an ips display and total multitouch point is 5 it has all sensors necessary for a tablet like gravity sensor orientation sensor etc but no proximity and ambient light sensor cause it does not have calling feature, as the gpu mali 400 quadcore is the same as the xtron so hence it is gr8 it played all hd games like dead trigger,asphalt 7,gta vice city ,iron man,real racing 3 , nfs most wanted,frontline commando d day etc buttery smooth and for the graphic benchmarking it scored 58.6 fps in nenamark 2 benchmark which is gr8. so i hope u have all ur queries cleared if ur budget is around 7 k then go for this beauty.
