It got hanged 3 times in the matter of 10 days. Some times the main speaker do not work properly. Camera also showing blank images once and had to restart the phone. In all the phone gets 10/10 but the product i received must be a faulty one.","positive":1},"performance":{"posr1":"Sexy looks, blazing fast performance, added protection with dust and waterproofing, and just about the perfect size for single-handed usage. Had the product delivered in a couple of days - amazing service as expected from Flipkart. The Z1C's price, though is uncomfortably close to the full-sized flagships, and feels psychologically incorrect to us Indians who usually relate size with value :)","positive":1},"camera":{"posr1":"It's an awesome mobile with good display and great specs. The camera is excellent outdoor in well lit places. But average for indoor. Except that all is well.","positive":1},"Battery":{"posr1":"U get a better Battery ! U get a better screen !
