{"programs":{"posr1":"Very good book those who started in programming, Not only this book find useful for making syntax and narration of language easy but also develop some logical skill through working programs and logic written in this book. Flipkart Delivery is always up to the mark & they use to deliver happiness with the product we order.","negr1":"i'm a BE student studying C as my 1st progm// language. It's really nice & helpful 2 have this book.+POINTS: 1. very good for beginners. 2. lots of data for complicated output related programs. -POINTS: 1. level of detail is quite high, but no. of completely writtten programms are very low in this book.","negative":1,"positive":1},"building":{"posr1":"Nice for basic programming Let Us C 8183331637 As usual flipkart did its best in delivering the product one can easily learn basic logic building with this book. Let us c is good enough ...for beginners","positive":1},"knowledge":{"posr1":"This is very useful book for freshers. because i have not proper basic knowledge about computer. even then i am understanding and getting knowledge through this book and covered 30% in just 15 days.you all could not imagine i am just metric pass and if i can understand then i think every one can do it. so please do not go away for c language.","posr2":"this is most simple book for programming beginners who have no basic knowledge of programming. easy language better than E Balaguruswamy. Despite more contradictions about authenticity and usefullness of this book it is good. If u have a knowledge about programming then purchase The C Programming language by D Ritchi.","positive":2},"programmer":{"posr1":"A great book to start C coding. Topics are excellently organized and very well explained... Highly recommended for those who want to be a good programmer in C. I liked the Linux part a lot but the preface to earlier editions is a bit confusing. Must Buy.. :D","posr2":"I am a seasoned programmer with over 10 years of working only on C. I have written parts of the Linux OS too. So trust me when I say this, I still refer to this book now and then. This book helped me gain an understanding of how to write C code in a pragmatic way.","positive":2},"commands":{"posr1":"This book may be very basic and simple for Computer-related studies, but for other studies like Mechanical and Civil, this book helps to understand what C program is. I found this book to be useful, as I am from the Mechanical Engineering background, and I found all the basic commands and other topics related to C, explained in a very simple manner.","positive":1},"concepts":{"posr1":"Hmm...Now this is the book a computer student or a newbie must have as it helps clear concepts or learn C at his/her own pace.A good book with many illustrative examples to help clear concepts and their practical use.An overall good book to have.Again a good job, Flipkart!","posr2":"I read this book in my first year of B.Tech; and since then developed a repulsion for this. It may teach you basic concepts in C; but do not expect to understand complex topics like pointers. The best book for C is \"ANSI C Programming Language\" by Late Sir Dennis Ritchie (he created it!).","positive":2},"beginner":{"posr1":"Let me buy, let us C Let me read, Let us C Let me work with let us C Let me tell u this is the best book for beginner available in market for C. Go for it without hesitation","posr2":"Let us C is always good for a new beginner in C programming specially. the delivery of book by Flipkart was nice but the books sucks.. the books outer cover looks like it has already been used by someone. it makes me feel that i had been cheated by Flipkart. so better avoid this book to buy in flipkart.","positive":2},"programming":{"posr1":"Nice for basic programming Let Us C 8183331637 As usual flipkart did its best in delivering the product one can easily learn basic logic building with this book. Let us c is good enough ...for beginners","posr2":"Good read and latest edition covers all topic well. Before any serious programming and big reference books, this book would not scare you from programming. It is good for engineers when they want to migrate to Matlab or any other scientific softwares.","positive":2},"skill":{"posr1":"Very good book those who started in programming, Not only this book find useful for making syntax and narration of language easy but also develop some logical skill through working programs and logic written in this book. Flipkart Delivery is always up to the mark & they use to deliver happiness with the product we order.","positive":1},"features":{"posr1":"Although easy to read, this book is full of factual errors. Certain features of C are implementation dependent, this fact needs to be addressed. All books by Yashavant Kanetkar should be avoided. I recommend K&R, which costs almost as much as this one (low price edition).","positive":1},"language":{"posr1":"this is most simple book for programming beginners who have no basic knowledge of programming. easy language better than E Balaguruswamy.

Author uses simple language and concepts are explained very well. It also has a number of exercise problems at the end of every chapter for practicing. Definitely worth buying it.","negr2":"this is worth for money. Great codes in simple language makes this the best book for reference ! kudos Yashawant Kanetkar.","negative":3,"positive":1}}
